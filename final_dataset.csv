3,"It needs work in areas, namely graphics, stability and quitting the server (why count down? why not just quit?). It clearly is inspired by the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series and to its credit, it nails it. There are problems with grammar and spelling, certain enemies too weak while others are too powerful, there is no voice chat and no way to check objectives. I commend the throwback to early 2000's gaming and to be certain, time is the ultimate reviewer but for now, the game is nowhere near finished. It needs a lot of work.  Now to the positives:  * Good atmosphere *Decent sound * Rogue like (not a fan) *Perfect for the hardcore crowd *Perfect horror vibe Negatives: * Enemies are improperly balanced * No way to check objectives *no way to log chats (I.E review them via PDA) *Players will not respond to you or help in anyway (i assume that means a hostile playerbase though i don't know) *despite being developed in 2020, it looks like Half life with HD models added * quitting the server is a 20 second wait, quitting period is 5 seconds. this is unskippable If you want to support development, do so. It seems to be lost on people that indie games are not easy to make. These people work long hours and in the midst of this epidemic, also worry about their safety as well. My prayers are with them. But donate if you can, it's only $7 for the supporters package. For sheer dedication alone, i commend them.   I recommend this game only due to the mechanics involved. It shows that the team has heart but whether or not they are able to pull it off remains to be seen. Still, i respect their determination. ",True,True

37,"Factorio is an amazing investment in conveyor production and mining of reurs. In addition to the overwhelming conomic, the southeast and the combat component are excellently served. The game captures all the attention of the first seconds. After all, from how conveniently the base will be built will depend on the success of your mission. We find on a hostile planet, about their special laws. The more we pollute the planet with production, the more hostile and aggressive forms of life become. The first love that comes when you first see the inhabitants of the planet is the zerg from StarCraft. So the more your factory is tanning, the more actively these zerg will attack. A fundamental moment of the game is the creation of a factory, which will automatically extract reurs and produce the things you need. Fortunately, they have various attachments, such as a conveyor belt and manipulators. It will come enough to dream up and experiment a lot in order to establish even a small and effective production. It looks very interesting to add the ability to create railroad tracks to add reurs to remote corners of the map. I've spent a lot of time automating that aspect of the game. Defense against projectile zerg also takes place in the most automatic mode. In addition to the southern line, there is also an excellent sandbox in which you can spend a lot of time with your friends. The game supports the creation of mods that increase the already huge functionality of the game. So how much variable the game will be depends only on your imagination. In Factorio, which is very nice, there is training. It is small and will briefly describe the main features of the game, and at first it just pushes you to create the first simple automations. For the construction of the first equipment, the reurs are obtained with proto pens. And you are like that, no problem, you start digging, chopping. The costs of reurs increase many times for each three-piece. And so you put on the howl of the first combine, the tape, and you realize that wow, that's convenient. You start to grind it wherever you can, and as the factory grows around the notes, conveyors with reurs, they are busily shifted by manipulators, that satisfied row of melting furnaces, moving like a living organism. It takes a couple of hours, you are so pleased, you rub your hands almost in ktaz - everything has been built, production is adjusted ... but then you finally notice what a mishmash of giblets, conveyor belts are twisted almost into a knot, ovens are rakid all over the factory, because there was not enough meta, the production of the curious from each other are located from each other at different ends of the map. You think for a long time and restart the game. it's easier to start over than to redo. And so many times. Feel free to boggle the southern part, the price, create a unique map for howl and build, create, fantasize, invite friends, or play without them. The multifaceted game with huge potential will put off few indifferent people, give it a chance even if you are not a fan of this genre. automatic! ",True,False
38,"Right now I regret not having given the game a chance in 2015, but although it was thrown after you in bundles back then, it never had a really large number of players and is more than dead at the present time, even if you still have it every now and then finds another lobby. Bloodsports.TV had potential, because it is really fun, but unfortunately it is more or less completely unplayable on its own, because it is frustratingly difficult because you have game over when you die (different with other players, where you respawn after a short time). Unfortunately, there are no bots either. By the way, this is not a MOBA, even if it is praised as one in other reviews, it is pure PvE, even if the inspiration of Warcraft 3 and MOBAs is obvious, based on the gameplay. ",True,False
39,"What an excellent game, easily my game of the year. Everything works for me, the art, the music, the atmosphere, the story and the joy of finally deducing someones identity from some small detail. The various fates of the doomed crew aboard Obra Dinn stayed with me even when I wasn't playing and this is that kind of a game that I would really like to experience for the first time again. Do yourself a favour and don't look for clues outside the game or try to guess someones identity without some certainty, because everything can be worked out by being observant of little details that you've seen or heard. These details help you put names to the faces, either confirming them or eliminating them from being that person. Those 'gotcha' moments are great and you might miss them if you try to make connections, like the Chinese seamen, by just changing their names around until you hit on the correct answer. It also helps to be aware of the timeline, because the game doesn't progress chronologically and it sometimes helps if you follow people and their actions through consecutive flashbacks. ",True,False

The gameplay involves you trying to climb to the top of a mountain of blocks, including dragging those blocks around to create a path to get higher. It gets challenging, though, especially on higher difficulty. When you're not doing that, you hang out in the local bar and talk to people or play actual arcade games. If you played Persona 5, imagine Sojiro's cafe with all your friends hanging out there but also if the other customers would have full conversations with you.

71,"I personally learned about that game a long time ago. But then it was only exclusive for the cones. When is it possible to play ""that"". The feelings were deep. I mean, the atmosphere is wildly ooba and frankly a drug addict.) In general, SUDA 51 does nothing but drugs, at least another exclusive for cannes - Lollipop Chainsaw was the same. Cheerleader with her boyfriend's head and a huge chainsaw eliminates zombies. Okay. distracted. In general, Killer is Dead. Plot: The thing is really Internet, not for the use of things of different origin. There are 12 missions in the game. Each of them is a job for a murderous monster. By the way, our hero Mondo Zappa works for a secret agency, where the main French American is half of his body covered with metal. (Action will take place in the future, because metal limbs are the norm). Our Monda also has a metal hand. I rubbed it on the south. Otherwise, the poilers will work. on the 5th, 8th and 11th we learn about the past of our hero. So, it is mainly in them. Gameplay: Typical lesher with pumping branches and unusual locations. From the lia's house, to the moon and oii.) Better to play amoma. Problems with optimization: Yes, there is a neat problem with the game. First, during the beginning of the 2nd mission, the game crashes on the roller at the milestones. To fix it, you need: In the KidEngine.ini file, in the XAudio2 section, change the text as described below. [XAudio2.XAudio2Device] MaxChannels = 64 Comm320 MinCompressedDurati0.3 MinCompressedDurati500 LowPassFilterRes0.9 WorkAroundXDKRegression = FALSE There is also an error about a call in 3 missions. Oh, I didn't have it, so I can't help it if you have it. In general, the game is stubborn, but it is an author, which means it is not for milestones! It is important. Don't puke from graphics? Japanese and Unicorn? You obviously are not. In general, it is your choice to play or not. The game is scored 10/10.

81,"RE2 Remake is an ashtounding game that have made which seemed imposible: get the calssic RE feeling, and adapt it to a present gampeplay. Especially playing in the hardest difficulty, when every bullet counts, and less inventory space (but maybe enemies do dtoo much amage) Talking about the games areas, the Police Deparment is amazing and is full of puzzles to solve. It's deffinetly the best zone of the game. The sewers are an improvement over the original sewers, but I believe the Remaked Lab, is worse than the original lab. But it has some minor flaws, things that wouldn't mind at all if it was new RE game, but being a RE2 Remake we need to have in mind some traits the original game had, but this Remake don't. For example, there is almost no difference betwen the A & B routes of each characters. Also there is no interaction beetwen a character A route and the other one B route as happened on the original game.  In original RE2, both characters will often engage with each other or  talk over a radio from time to time,  plotting about how they're gonna escape the nightmare, about finding Sherry, etc. Even there were a couple of items you coulnd't pick on B route, if you had taken that item during the related A route or even some that you could only get during B route if you have done the right stuff during A route. Summarizing, interaction between the 2 main characters and between the routes, are far worse than the original game Nevertheles, It's a wonderull game, and I hope Capcom will use this game as a base for RE8 than to follow the base of REVII and definetly it's the GOTY of 2019 together with FF XIV: Shadowbringers ",True,False

It was worth the price, missions feel rewarding, building destruction, firefights are good to watch, destroying things feels nice. Story is decent and keeps you going, sometimes comical. My favourite part is the feeling of firepower and explosions. Game is realism based so the units, vehicles and tanks are built around that. Tanks for example fire the appropriate type of shell's + machine guns. The damage to vehicles is done so individual parts can be damaged/repaired. Infantry units are controlled in platoons, you don't have to control each and every troop with hundreds of mouse clicks. It is easy to sit back and take control over the battlefield once you get the hang of things. The learning curve is learnt over the 1st few missions which you might find yourself getting frustrated with. This is because your not doing it right, a 1st play through the 1st couple of missions will help you to understand how the mechanics work.

In addition, they made the same mistake as the creators of Deus Ex Mankind Divided during the time, focusing on future tasks, and at the same time cutting off the current story rather abruptly. As a result, just like in Deus Ex MD, we have more than the previous chat and a feeling of incompleteness, although the original plans have been reached. - By the time of passage, the game is opotavim the last chapter, however, there are fewer bright and memorable prices, but they often go off scale and they are always cool. - The graphics are quite good, although not every location is suitable for crinshots. However, these are really little things, but the next one beats: the game jumps from the gameplay into the videos, and these transitions are too noticeable both in the picture (in the same scale, for example), and in the black stripes on the top and bottom (of course, to render several options it was too lazy or to do it on the game engine, and not on separate videos). Also, the game in a pair of meta is too dark, which will make it difficult to find collectible items, and an increase in the overall ruminance in the settings spoils the picture as a whole (they could put a flashlight into the game). - The gameplay is the same by me as well. However, in the field of the first chat in management, you feel something is not right, more canny or something ... It seems that the first chat on the PC was given more attention. In addition, here and there curvatures float in, for example, it can get somehow dive into a puddle or stumble upon an invisible threshold when exiting the elevator (come jump out). And in general, it is better not to go into shallow water once again: expect to find secrets, once jumped on the new path to eat lightly flooded with meto containers and somewhere spontaneously dived, somewhere he just started to jerk and only miraculously climbed out, but the hero's unwillingness to climb some rather low objects were frankly beating, reminding you that you have to explore along the originally conceived routes. Needless to say, there was nothing there? Yes, in the last game it was also not possible to climb everywhere, but there the design of the milestones was trickier and you didn’t even look at those meta that you couldn’t pick up, and here in the same ruins it obviously didn’t happen. Plus, in the southern chapter of the penthouse for me in one meta, the game was stable when switching from gameplay to video (as it turned out, it was only necessary to check the integrity of the CSA, the game had something to do with updates). In the previous chats of the described technical problems, I did not notice, as well as problems in general. In the good, the optimization pleased me, I flew on the ultras, no matter how tranno. - A little more about the ""competent"" level design. In the game, for example, it is possible to miss the southern cook at the beginning due to the fact that you go to the base and complete the southern task in advance ... Thus, you can miss the acquaintance of Shoshanna (monkey cat), that video did not see for the first time. - There was more drama in the game. Yes, she is not as competently and tensely pushed as it was in the first chat, but that's it. Everyone decides whether it is good or bad. However ... Blakovitz somehow sharply talanted a little smarter and more talkative, and his monologues are more emotional - that's what spoils the impression. Peronazh has always been a machine for killing Nazis with a minimum of motions and tricky soaps (there was something of an animal in it, a man on intinks), even in their last game he was much more brutal, and here half of the game he generally whines deeply and then also beats. after all, this is completely different from him. - There are no more boas. Proto can sometimes throw large opponents, but they already meet in the boh. And it's sad that, unlike the first chat, they didn't let the main antagonite be avenged by hand. - Humor. uuuu ... In general, the level of humor has dropped a little and generally leads to mats and the topic of eka. It’s not always successful, but they also caused a smile - here it’s taste and color, for someone this humor goes more. And then it was just about the conversation of the Germans on the submarine, when they talked about xD of the ugly Blakovits. In the first there were more subtle jokes ... I often defend the voice acting in games, you concentrate on it more on the gameplay, but not here. Yes, that is not a masterpiece ""the train made a boom"" and it sounds very good (except maybe some technical moments). However, they don’t bother to convey motions, the moments of intonation are not the same (apparently the new one was voiced not by the sight of what was happening), the new jumping loudness, some moments were incorrectly voiced (for example, you catch the catch ""time to swim"" on an already swam submarine, when the original was to immerse the oblique) but ama speck In the last video: it looks like they have been hammered into the bare track and will either completely thaw out, then they will overtake and often you see in the frame either proto-mouth-opening characters, or not into the booming head of another character. This, coupled with the rather abrupt end of the game, stifled my confused impressions ... ",True,False

Shooting is done smartly, for 10+, and everything is great - either lazy, or at the level of ""well ... okay, it will sweat."" In principle, 80% of the gameplay is trill, so as a shooter in an open world, it's probably not bad. Although even here there is such a thing that at the end of the day you are dead and your enemies have nothing to oppose to you. Strange ituyevina gets - and there are a lot of weapons and it is interesting, it bangs well, spitting top-notch, and there is almost nowhere to use it. Prmo now I wanted a huge crowd to run out, like in Serious Sm, to triple the pizza chopper, and figs to you. It's a shame, you go so vetted, and only a small change runs from under your feet. Maybe they ate once in the south, then there will be a challenge, but such a person who will not rest until the vu card is dusty, so a fatty boar came to the final bow, and the proto crushed it and smeared it with a thin loom on the Putoshi wei. What else? Plot? u ... he is. but the level of not the most skillful fan fiction. Periodically, he tries to portray something out of fucking, but he doesn't get it very well. Peronages? Straight, like a tram rail, without personality and character, but a bunch of ""queues"", which in the end lead to a total definition of everything around him and pressing another button, which does something important southern. Open world? Even speaking, I never understood why there is an open world at all. He will blow out of the grind, read-out avanpots, mutant nests and other similar entertainments. There is nothing to go there, nothing to study. However, the next bandit avanpot means the opportunity to shoot, otherwise it would at least blow. Mad Max otol from the same thing, but he somehow got to do things in such a way that the bandits didn’t get bored of chasing the mud and making faces. Chasing caravans? The first couple of times it's cool, until you realize that these caravans are endless and are needed only for the farm of spare parts. Music? I didn't remember her at all. As a result, everything that is taken about the trill, about the obnosty and destruction of his living, only praises, and for another detail - the proto dull jerk, which even from Yubioft gets much better. I do not recommend buying for the full price, but about a throwaway of at least 75% - you can watch. ",True,False

156,"A copy of my opinion. Based on the results - awesome. Motivation to replay above the head, because G + content was brought in a lot. Maybe I bend it, but in my opinion the best thing is that the moment of the release of RE4 is better. Not the fact that the game is pretty thin (at least on hardcore, let's see what's on the nightmare). If you didn't edit it on the search engine, then the name of the original, Last Escape, suits you so well. A sweaty, fierce kshen, a perfectly reworked emezi, which at that time feels like it’s getting used to it. In general, my expectations were more than met. I got not a proto remake, but a completely new game, which is much better than the original. RE2 2019 was exactly a remake, and not the best. Absolutely, good, but many things in it were very badly racked up. RE3 2020 is excellent. The only thing I can get to with is the hitboks around which Dark Souls nervously smokes in the funnel. However, it didn’t prevent me from stabbing the hunter with a knife on hardcore. The second is not a good point, then there are two practically identical boemes. If you could make him a really cool and interesting enemy, then you could additionally adjust his will. All in all, we have an absolutely new, overwhelmingly awesome and driving Resident Evil 3, without any remake. This is not a remake. This is a novelty of the series. ",True,False

170,"Star Conflict is team-based action game that takes place in space. You are a pilot of battle spaceship and your main goal is to destroy enemy's forces, capture important objectives or destroy ""boss ships"".  The story of this game takes place 300 years after first colonial spaceships full of people were launched into space. There are multiple factions that continuously fight over the galaxy. The strongest ones are ""Empire"" , ""Federation"" and  ""Jericho"".  Game is split into 2 main gamemodes = PvE (Player VS. Environment), where players team-up together and fight against computer-controlled spaceships made by aliens, who try to utilize battles between factions to take over the galaxy. Second article is PvP (Player VS. Player), where players fight against each other in teams or in Free-For-All mode.  To be honest, I really like graphics of this game and I'm sure that main reason why I like that is the game engine. Each of factions have their own ""spaceships, which are unlocked by research.  Research is made using game money earned from battles, completing quests and challenges. You can also earn ""spaceship parts"", which are used to build special alien spaceships, that have improved stats (And they also look pretty cool).  This game is very similar to ""WarThunder"" by game mechanics and style of gameplay. Main differences are maps, missions and type of battle machinery.

188,"Bioshock is a action-filled fps game with adventure, horror and looter elements set in the underwater dystopian city Rapture ruled by Andrew Ryan. Your mission is to escape. Bioshock has become a cult-classic game in its own genre but is it really that good? Positive: + Graphics are fairly decent. Remastered isn't too different from original but both look unique and cool anyway! + Awesome creepy dystopian atmosphere which fits the game well + Soundtrack is good, although the same voice lines are common. + Game world is kind of a blend of open world and linear levels, anyway it succeeds in creating the narrow and scary atmosphere where enemies could be anywhere. Neutral: • Gameplay is not bad by any means but not perfect either. The idea of spell-like plasmids and a whole bunch of different weapons is really cool but it was a bit clunky, which is perhaps acceptable as it's an old game. There could've been made easy improvements to polish it. • Controls are okay but the weapon/plasmid selection could have been implemented in other ways. Yeah it was fast to switch between things but I didn't really like it. Movement felt a bit clunky as you couldn't move smoothly. • The looting mechanics were decent as there were a bunch of ammo, other equipment items and audio logs to gather. I also enjoyed the ADAM harvesting and upgrading system. • Story which there wasn't that much in form of chatacters or cutscenes but rather audio logs etc. I guess story is okay but they could've made it more functional and progress faster. The core idea of the story is good tho. Negative: - Hit boxes are really annoying as player tended to get stuck and not hit enemies 'cause of them. - AI and combat balance isn't really that good, enemies aren't really realistic and are sometimes really frustarating. Enemies consume just too much ammo and some enemies deal a lot of damage really fast, especially Big Daddies were a big challenge 'cause I had to use like multiple medkits and a BIG load of ammo (which I sometimes didn't really have) to kill it. In my opinion some enemies should have died more easily, especially from headshots and the player shouldn't die from just 2 hits without using medkit. - I heard many people had a LOT of crashing issues but I only experienced like once. Which bothered me was the constant fullscreen mode problems, which worked out after multiple attempts by switching the resolution. Sometimes the game window turned black, which forced me to start from the latest save.. Performance was good though. This game is sometimes forgiving in combat but also at times you keep dying because of lack of medical supplies, ammo or money. Vita chambers offer a certain help for the player but if you're low on ammo, money and medical supply... you're screwed. Story- or gameplay-wise this game didn't really offer me anything good over other games but still I enjoyed the looks, soundtrack, atmosphere and overall concept of this game. The core combat and movement mechanics are clunky but the looting / upgrade system was really nice. I have only played the remaster version so can't make a comment on if there are more or less problems but there certainly are many in Remastered. In conclusion, buy this game if you wish to experience the unique atmosphere and look of Rapture, not really worth story or gameplay for me. Though play this game at your own risk as there definitely are many problems in fields of bugs, game stability and the gameplay itself. Altogether: [ 7,5 / 10 ]  The core playthrough took me 10 hours which could be higher as in the endgame I didn't really have patience to keep exploring everything as there were more enemies and less resources. A decent experience set in an unique looking and feeling world which is shadowed by many flaws, which aren't insurmountable but rather just annoying and clunky. For some people it could be a nostalgic game but for me it didn't have any extra value. Well it's an old game so the standards have certainly risen but this review was based on the experience itself, not by comparing to other games. ",True,False

228,"Halo Wars Definitive Edition is a timeless classic RTS game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios, taking place in the Halo universe. Players get to control all of the Halo universe enemies and hero's.    The player's gameplay of Halo Wars consists of building and controlling army's to destroy their opponents base, while defending their own. Players will construct structures and base's to produce a variety of units, such as tanks, Spartans, ODST squads, Grunts and Ghosts. Bases are locked locations with limited building zones, however can be upgraded to account for more buildings. Buildings include reactors, turrets, barracks, mortar pools, and aircraft stations. Halo wars plays like an RTS game but is restrictive in population and building locations. This doesn't take away from the RTS gameplay much, however may be frowned upon by hardcore RTS players.  The story of Halo Wars follows Sergeant Forge on his journey under the command of Captain Cutter. The story and gameplay of the campaign has variety and has been polished, but has a tendency to let they player camp down and wait without much backlash. The voice acting and visuals of the campaign are solid and fit well, and Halo Wars is a good looking game for its time. The campaign follows Forge on various planets fighting Covenant and other enemies, some of which include fungal life forms. Disappointingly, the Fungal Life forms are not a playable race.  Halo Wars Definitive Edition  does some things right: •Fun skirmish and multiplayer  •Pretty well balanced •Great looking game  •Campaign feels like halo •Variety of campaign missions •Good story Halo Wars Definitive Edition does a few things wrong: •Can turtle in most campaign missions •Can win most matches by spamming a single unit type  •Skirmish AI can be dumb •Decent but unpolished voice overs •Lack of skirmish refining & feels unfinished  Overall, Halo Wars Definitive Edition is a classic and fantastic RTS game. To hardcore RTS fans, it may lack features other RTS games have, however this does not take away from the game at all.

About the customization: The customizatión of everything in this game is awesome, you can custome your cars more than in a lot of games of cars...

314,"Earth. Wind. Fire. Water. These are the ingredients that make up.....the   Alright, that was a dumb reference! Anyway, these are the basic elements of course! Video games include them sporadically all the time, but what about a game that includes   of them? Well, let's see how it is! Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone is a hidden object game (HOG, for short). If you're not familiar with HOGs, essentially they're a clickfest with a story and puzzles attached. The basic gameplay consists of you clicking on objects to either collect or interact with them to progress the story. This time around, the plot is about a woman, Emma, whose uncle, Alfred, has dedicated his life to pursuing the mythical philosopher's stone. Y'know, the one that is supposed to turn basic metals into gold? Now, the game never really explains much about the stone, but I feel like that's because Artifex Mundi HOGs tend to be a bit weak in the story department. See, this game is published by Artifex Mundi, and at least from my experience, it seems like the basic story of each of their hidden object titles is mostly the same. You play as female X and need to rescue/find family member Y, who is probably interested in or searching for object/location/thing Z. Now, there's nothing wrong with this basic concept, don't get me wrong - in fact, I think it's important that more video games include female protagonists. Yet, this all just makes it feel like the game is treading familiar ground in the HOG department - if you've played one, the story won't really feel unique at all. Actually funnily enough, two Artifex Mundi HOGs I played recently were surprisingly similar in some ways to this one: Time Mysteries involves moving through various themed areas (time periods in that game and elemental-themed areas in this one), while Tibetan Quest's ""final boss"" used the same memory-based gameplay as in this game to defeat it. Despite the ""hey, I've seen this all done before!"" feeling of the game's plot, I must compliment the game in terms of its gameplay. I've played a decent amount of hidden object games by now, but I was really surprised at the diversity of puzzles and hidden object scene types here. Usually, the types of puzzles are recycled from game to game, but there was a fair amount of new ones (to me at least) in this game. In addition to that, the hidden object scenes themselves were not only beautifully detailed but also had multiple types which surprised me a bit. Some involved the usual word lists (a bit like those ""I Spy"" books), but quite a few were different. Lists of pictures or symbols were sometimes used, which in my opinion made the scenes harder yet also helped diversify the gameplay, which was nice. Graphically the game looks pretty beautiful, like I said earlier. The landscapes are fantastic and the hidden object scenes look great. The characters look a little strange, but I think it's hard to get a good balance between realistic-looking and cartoony, so I think the developers struck a decent balance at least. In terms of sound, the game is standard fare for a HOG: simple yet calming music and a general lack of sound effects besides affirmatives (like a little ""whoosh"" if you pick up an item or whatnot). The voice acting is nothing noteworthy in my opinion. Or at least, the protagonist just sounds pretty neutral about everything. It seems like she lacks emotion most of the time, even though [slight spoilers--->] . Oh, and the uncle's voice actor is a little better, but still not great. The game is a ""collector's edition"", like most if not all of Artifex Mundi's Steam releases. This means that the game contains a bonus chapter that's about 1-2 hours long on top of the main game, which takes around 3-5 hours to beat. The length of the game is pretty average compared to others in its genre, but I think that it's just about the perfect length. Any longer and I'd personally get bored from the repetitive nature of the gameplay, and any shorter and I'd feel like my money wouldn't be well spent.  Overall though, I enjoyed my time with Mythic Wonders. It has some problems, mainly in the ""samey"" feeling of the plot and the lackluster voice acting, but the pleasant music, lovely visuals, and interesting mechanics of the puzzles help propel it to a solid recommendation from me. Gameplay-wise, Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone is superb. The puzzles are varied and fairly unique, and the hidden object scenes themselves were diverse in their types of lists of objects to find. It also certainly helps that the game looks quite nice. Despite the lackluster story and uninspired voice acting, this is a great hidden object game that any fan of the genre certainly should check it out. ",True,False

And yes from 2012 to 2016 I was playing on Xbox most of the time, didn't get the PC version of BO2 until 2016. Some annoying times, mostly good times. + BO2's Campaign is my personal favorite out of the CODs I have played (well, honestly BO2 and BO3 are really the games I have completed the Campaign) as it mixes the past and the future into one. Good story, good missions and Menendez will always be my symbol of anarchy. + BO2's Multiplayer is nonetheless perfect. Some may consider this the best MP in the Black Ops series and I totally agree with that to an extent. I never got to play online which is unfortunate, but local gets the job done. I do remember the first time I got my hands on BO2 back in 2012. 10 year-old me was sitting in my brother's friend's house with a PS3 and I was pretty much dominating them with the R870 MCS, and I didn't even know how to sprint! Solid maps like Hijacked, Standoff, NukeTown 2025 and Slums were top notch. + BO2's Zombies will always be in my heart. I didn't know until the release of BO3 that TranZit was reviewed so terribly, but me and my brother played Town for most of the time camping in the bar with LMGs. Die Rise is personally better than TranZit, but again didn't know until the release of BO3 that it was reviewed poorly. Mob of the Dead is my go-to no matter what. I had to wait 2 years before I could personally get my hands on any DLC, and it was definitely worth it. Buried is a well-balanced map. Good camping spot, good gameplay and we all can't forget LEEROYYY!!! And lastly, Origins is my second go-to map. Almost everything was good about it, and I could play it for days non-stop. Jason Blundell really outdid himself with MOTD and Origins which is why many consider them the best maps of all time. + However, BO2 is definitely not worth $60-90 in 2019, MP and Zombies is unpopulated or riddled with hackers and I will recommend you wait for a sale purely for the Zombies and the Campaign.

It feels way more polished and way better executed than the first game and you really feel immersed in the game while playing.

It ties into the Warhammer lore and it has a few Warhammer aspects going on in terms of the world surrounding you, but when I play this game it feels like it's own world instead of the world of Warhammer. That is probably because I view Warhammer as a franchise which mostly consists of strategy games, and Vermintide 2 is vastly different. You view the world from a different perspective and instead of an all out war, you are fighting a Skaven/Chaos plague. It feels very refreshing and that is a great thing. It goes to show that the Warhammer franchise has something to offer for everybody. (Well maybe except for racing fans. Warhammer Karting game when?) Now on to the graphics. The characters and the enemies look very detailed and they fit right in with the world surrounding them, which is stunning in it's own right. they really put work into making the game look good and fitting for the Warhammer universe. The environments feel diverse and colourful, and it does it's best to make you invested in the world surrounding you. I have not had any graphics that looked especially bad or muddy. The gameplay is fast paced and brutal. it does not encourage hacking and slashing like a dumbarse and you have to think about when to dodge, when to strike and how to go about your business in this world. the classes are very diverse and you play with a team of four people. this is a good thing as well as a bad thing because you never go out as a team consisting of all 5 characters, but it makes sure that you try out other classes as well as planning who takes on which role.  You walk through linear levels and get little bits of story every now and then, but the gameplay mostly revolves around defeating your enemies, and looking cool while doing that. Overall I heavily recommend this game if you like Left 4 Dead or Nazi Zombie Army Trilogy type games, but if you don't then it might still be worth picking it up just for slaying some Skaven. I give this game an 8/10 ",True,False

361,"So apparently ""zenzizenzic"" is a mathematical term for the fourth power of a number, or something like that. Anyway, the game itself is a super fun, intense, infuriatingly difficult twin stick shooter with tight controls, a great soundtrack, many colourful enemies, and many many bullets. There are 2 game modes: • Classic • Macro Classic mode lets you play through 5 increasingly difficult levels, each with their own theme. You can choose Normal, Hard, or Very Hard difficulty. You equip 2 special weapons from a selection of about 6, with each one offering different strategies. These include missile barrages, black holes, teleportation, huge laser beams, and high-power charge shots. Then you jump straight into the bullet hell, and you will find yourself obliterating waves of enemies, dodging bullets, getting hit by bullets, dying, and saying ""Again!"" You can also train against the 5 bosses, practise the bonus levels (in which you have to dodge your way through various obstacle courses), or challenge yourself by playing Gauntlet mode, where you play through all 5 levels in a single run. The individual levels only take a few minutes to complete, so if you just want to open the game and blast through (or die in) a couple of levels, you can do that. 'Macro' is an interesting open-world roguelike mode, with shops, upgrades, useable items, and huge bosses. This can also be played on Normal, Hard and Very Hard. It's a very fun mode that offers a different style of gameplay to the Classic mode, as well as a lot of replayability like every good roguelike. You can also play co-op, which I haven't tried, but it seems like it would work well. There's a lot here to keep you interested if you like bullet hell and twin stick shooters. I definitely recommend this game to people who are looking for challenges, highscores, or just a load of fun. ",True,False

374,"genre : horror game in 1st person rating : 7/10 - graphics : simple but functional, not much detail in environment, good lighting effects - sound : creepy sounds and nice music at times, passable voice acting - story : it has to do with the afterlife (or more accurately between this life and death). I don't want to spoil the details, i will say that the story at the beginning seems very interesting (the matter is something that concerns everyone) and i always like to hear people's opinions on the subject even if it's a game. What spoiled the game for me was the ending, was waiting to see where it was going and it seems the central idea is that of the new age crap. Life review etc. At least that's what i got. No Jesus Christ mention and i guess the God (in God's basement) is not the One we Christians believe in. Again that is what i got from the whole story , which ofcourse i didn't like. - gameplay : typical walking simulator (i don't like the term, but it has become popular to describe games like this), the main gameplay revolves around doing things in certain order , what i found pretty interesting was the use of the zoom function in a very clever way. I also liked how the flashlight moves naturally according to your movement. - scare factor : not much, but again i'm not easily scared. Many creepy moments though, especially at the end, a certain description...  good use of sound. - oprimization : runs perfect with no issues.  To sum it up, way above average indie horror game in 1st person, with an interesting story/setting , that could be much better story wise (apart from what i mentioned above) if the main character's life example was not that extreme and all the circumstances playing role in his life were not that unusual, so we could immerse ourselves more in the story.  Still recommended and since it's the developer's first game i think he could use some support. ",True,False

In general, a very striking and fun game mode stands out, the gameplay is a very strong point in this game and when it comes to sound and soundtracks there is not much to tell the truth, in my opinion it seems to be normal. What this game really stands out for is the ease of having fun ""If you have 3 companions to play with."" Once you have a group armed and ready to play, the rest is history. The missions, characters, roles are very well thought out.

400,"I'll start in english, but I will make my review in french too ! (review en français plus bas pour les intéresser) This game is a love letter to games like Castle Crashers and Newgrounds games. It's not as good as Castle Crashers but it's develop by one guy and knowing that, the game is really good ! The developper deserve more praise for making it and the game deserve more attention It reminds me a lot of the time of Flash games, and if you are nostalgic of this kind of game or just want to play a game which feel  like this, I think you should buy it ! Graphics and desgin are really cool, we feel the ""the behemoth"" influence of course, but I really enjoy it. Some music are pretty good, but some are a bit weak too (Music from the first level and bosses could be better in phase with the game). Gameplay, it's a beat'em up with a feeling of flash game. Of course it could be better and it's not as good as game like Castle Crashers or Fight n'rage, but for a first game I think it's pretty good  Some boss have great pattern and good game design (the last boss should have it's own creepypasta, memorable as it is^^ ) . There are a lot of bonus level that are all different from one an other and brings some variety.There are secrets in all levels  and Hard mode, so there is some replayability too. For the cons, what the game really needs is a controller support. I don't know if it's hard to make (I'm not a developper) but for a game like this, it would be a graat improvement. I had some trouble with the keyboard, I had multiple time the feeling that some input doesn't respond because I was already moving or something like that. I don' t know how to really explain it, but I had this feeling that not all my input respond like it should (I had a lot of trouble with the dash). I think it's where improvemment could be made..  In conclusion, The misadventure of Melon is a great game for it's price and I think it deserve more attention. I hope to see more stuff from Rhys510 in the future because I enjoy my time on this game (I have some secrets to find and hard mode to try, so my (mis)adventure si not finish ! ^^) And sorry if my english is not great, I'm french ^^. Pour les français: Ce jeu est une lettre d'amour pour des jeux comme Castle Crashers et les jeux Newgrounds. Un sentiment de ""jeu flash"" ce dégage du jeu et si vous êtes nostalgique de cette époque, ou chercher juste un jeu avec ce sentiment, je vous conseille de lui donner sa chance !  Les graphismes et design sont vraiment sympa, on ressent l'influence de ""The Behemoth"" mais perso je kiffe ce genre, et donc ça ne me dérange pas d'en voir dans le même style ^^. Pour les musiques , il y en a des biens et des moins bien , certaines pourraient être plus en phase avec le jeu (notament celle du 1er level et des boss ) Niveau gameplay, c'est un beat'em up avec un ressenti jeu flash. Bien sûr ça pourrait être mieux et n'égale pas des titres comme Castle Crashers ouf Fight n'rage, mais pour le premier jeu de ce développeur (seul au développement) je trouve ça déj  bien réussi et sympathique. Certains boss sont vraiment bon avec de bon pattern et game design. Il y a pas mal de niveau bonus tous différent les un des autres , ce qui apporte de la variétés. Et niveau rejouabilité, il y a des secrets dans chaque niveau et un mode hard. L  où le jeu pourrait être améliorer (et l  où sont ses défauts ) , le jeu devrait vraiment avoir une compatibilité manette. Pour un beat'em up cela apporterait beaucoup. Je ne sais pas si c'est compliqué   rajouter (je ne suis pas développeur) mais ca apporterai un grand plus. Car j'ai eu des problèmes au niveau des contrôles au clavier. Je ne sais pas si ça vient dem on clavier ou non, mais j'ai souvent eu l'impression que des touches ne répondait pas comme il fallait quand j'avais par exemple une direction déj  enclenché. J'ai donc appris au fur et   mesure   lâcher toutes les autres touches dès que je voulais faire une action, mais ça reste perturbant en soit et c'est l  dessus que des améliorations pourraient être faites je pense. Ca restait jouable quand même. En conclusion, The misadventure of Melon est un bon ptit jeu pour son prix et mèrite définitivement plus d'attention. J'espère voir d'autre jeu de ce développeur parce que j'ai apprécier mon temps sur ce jeu (où il me reste des choses   débloquer + le hard mode   faire ! ^^) ",True,False

408,"So, I started playing Crossout long before it was released in the team, and I had to get some impressions from the game. First of all, he wants to show that the project has proto OGYE prospects. The main thing is that they are correctly implemented. I would like to proto indicate the pluses and minuses of the game, but it turned out to be too false to do that, because where there are pluses there are there and mines. Because rakazhu points: Graphics. Weight and weight on the level. We have done it beautifully and internally. Optimization is also pleasing. The game runs even on tare cars, although it slows down. kind of like robbing to optimize. Craft. Here you can tell a lot, because that is the main feature of the game. The player is given a certain number of parts, and from them he can make whatever and whatever. The player has full freedom of creativity when the howling of the machine. New parts will affect crafting from reurs, obtained in battle, as well as for obtaining faction ranks (more on that below). It would seem great and interesting, oh! The player will be wise to restrict a certain number of parts on the car, mao, short, number of weapons, etc. It seems to be correct and logical, but the feeling of being deprived of it is equal. As if you came for the Swedish language and you say ""you can eat as much as you want and what you want, but only from that platter."" As a result, we cannot realize our great creative potential, and that is upsetting. Gameplay. There are several types of PvE gameplay in the game, as well as many PvP cards. The battles are dynamic, interesting and spectacular. The player, through the craft of the car, will be able to tune the car to match the unique style of the game, because in PvP we see melee and niper attacks and art wiped out and diversions ... in general, the game gives us the opportunity to play as he wants, and that pleases. the limitations of the bowl above prevent the ""imbo machine"" from being built. o et nuan, namely .... Balan. The details in the game are balanced pretty well, just like the guns. The problem is players' balancing. How does it get that I get into a battle against a player who has a thousand less power points, and at the same time he will kill me in a fraction of a second? Each battle is completely random, since in that game there are not only stupid teammates, one-shots and shots on laby meta, but also craft that does not support protection from fools. As a result, your teammate may have a car hung with barrels of fuel, a car that drives a snail, or a proto idiot without a weapon. And there is nothing you can do about it. By the way, it does not always radiate, but it is not enough. Often ituatsi arises when you bend over with this or that weapon. You think ""Oh imba!"" You save up money, buy it, buy it ... and the gun is full oh! How so? the point is in the unique and thoughtful design of the machine that you bent over. Simply put, in order to win at least sometimes, you have to think, change, disappoint and think new. Ming or plunge, it's not for me to decide. A matter of taste. Pumping. Separately, he wants to talk about pumping, since it is an important element of the game, and only she will expand the boundaries of Kraft. Simply put, by gaining experience in battle, you get ranks from the ""factions"", and for these ranks you are given parts, cracks, new gameplay, expanding the treasure and the maximum number of parts. Until a certain moment, it’s fine, but in the end you start to grind elementary, as long as nothing else will not give you anything else. At about level 15, you will be pumping the rank for a LONG time, and I personally don't like that. Considering that they also bend you periodically, not giving you experience, the duration of the crayfish increases significantly. from this one more ""feature"" of the game is investigated ... Grind. And the wild one. You will come to grind ve and in (well, or bunch in trade). It would seem, well, where there is no grind, but here it is multi-level. Simply put, to craft violet, you need to craft 7 other guns for it, and to craft them you need 3 white parts + reurs each. Grind, grind, grind ... A lot of merciless grind. Trade. there is nothing to say oobo. Trading between players is realized by the ""auction"" in its positive and negative sides. Do you want to earn? Speculate on auctions, sell reurs, craft parts and sell them. In general, the choice of earnings is rich. The bottom line.

410,"This is a hard game for me to review. As an experience, it's spectacular. The sound, cinematography, story themes, graphics, character design, everything about the presentation is superb. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The game however, is mediocre. It's repetitive action style mob fighting that became popularized by Batman's Arkham series and the Assassin's Creed franchise, over and over again. (Although, a case could be made that this is intentional to serve the story) These fights are separated by puzzles, which admittedly come in different flavors, but not nearly different enough. The most repetitive of the puzzles being looking for rune symbols in the geography and environment to open locked doors. By the end of the game I felt the grind and drudge of looking for these damned things. A neat mechanic the first few times, not necessarily on the 20th. I think a large chunk could have been cut out of the third act, and the game would have benefitted so much from it. Definitely play this game in short bursts and not all at once to keep yourself from (either intentionally or unintentionally) being burned out. That being said, overall I think it's worth the experience. The developer's are great supporters of Mental Health Awareness, and have clearly done their research. They deserve your money, and you deserve to experience Senua's story. ",True,False

419,"Taking place in a post-apocalyptic future when a plague called Green Lung runs rampant, you are stricken with the disease and must resort to performing lottery jobs, hoping to win a vaccine that will help extend your life. Although the science is somewhat questionable, the game contains some really great worldbuilding details, such as Reaper-themed children’s rhymes and propaganda inspired by real WWI and WWII examples. I love that the game’s title basically came about the same way as the name Guybrush from   - it just happened to be what the computer file was called and never changed. A story is always improved when the designer knows the details of their world, even if those details don’t necessarily ever get conveyed to the player. However, I do wish that the endings were a little more fleshed out, because some of the reasoning behind certain choices being ‘bad’ was unclear to me. One of the best things about listening to the commentary is that you get to hear where the game’s team challenged themselves, took feedback, and experienced professional growth. According to the commentary, this is the first game where Dave Gilbert was the producer rather than the developer/designer - that was done by Francisco Gonzalez along with the art director Ben Chandler. This was Francisco’s first full worldbuild, and it sounds like there were some learning curves in the narrative process. Inspiration came from many sources, but my favorite is the fop aristocracy inspired by  . The art draws you into the universe from the get-go, even having the Wadjet Eye logo in the game’s color scheme. It was fun to hear about the level of complexity that went into even small sections of the game to enhance the immersive experience. As an example, the Market has 25 randomized pedestrians and 27 randomized store customers in a scrolling screen to give it a bustling and active community feel. I appreciate that the developers respected the players’ intelligence and worked hard to create interactive exposition opportunities rather than info dumps. I had a lot more respect for the guitar and strings soundtrack after listening to the commentary. There was a lot of discussion on live versus digital instruments and the complexities of transcribing digital compositions to what human fingers can do. It was also fun to hear Abe Goldfarb as a villain. Although not the most unique and well-developed post-apocalyptic tale ever, it’s still a solid and enjoyable experience worth your while if you’re a fan of point-and-click adventures. ",True,False

431,"This game is probably best experienced if you go in blind, but if you aren’t sold yet, here’s a taste of what to expect. There are small hints of the game’s disturbing nature early on. The characters’ poetry that you read deals with more serious ideas and feelings. The plucky girl next door writes about putting her happy feelings in a jar and then smashing them, the shy girl about obsession and death, and the cute but mean one writes about the futility of choice. The dialogue for these characters was also a little ironic, and at times, just plain sad. After a while, Doki Doki Literature Club started getting hostile towards me, the player. Not the player character, but me, the person making choices. It took control of my mouse, obscured parts of the screen to keep me from choosing certain options, and characters would speak to me in ways that indicated they knew they were in a game.

462,"""Exciting unexpected journey"" as unexpected as it began, so unexpectedly and ended. So briefly you can intoxicate the impressions of the game. It was extremely nice to immerse myself in the atmosphere of the games of those teas. It enchants, brings pleasure and enjoyment. You can drink the game for a long time, it is extremely rich in milestones of gameplay, from tilitika and atmosphere to gameplay. I'll try to take opiates briefly. Graphically, the game looks milking well. Feels that a lot of attention has been paid to detailing vevit. The game does not look the same, does not get bored, does not tire. There are a large number of different types of enemies: from the usual worker in a T-shirt to armored (semi-immortal =) fighters. There are enemies who can use teleport, slow down chow and more. And they fade not only as they pass, on the battlefield can be found at the same time and robots in T-shirts and mechanical work, which trill electrical discharges. That is, who was on the object, he is at war. So there is a great variety of weapons. From a pistol to a plasma rifle and rocket launcher. The gameplay of the game is also not deprived. The main feature is a trip to tea. It has a miracle cat that can slow down, speed up or stop tea. around this ve and twisted. am will be allowed to fight in the myth, and in the dungeons, and in the mountains, and in the clear field. Do not get tired of the same type of locations. The downside is that the game is a corridor shooter. For those teas it is not uncommon. le gameplay, itori, atmosphere, and in general vevit games will allow you to forget about it. And the developers rattled to minimize the effect of the corridor. They made it possible to go the other way, but very close and in most cases without any trough. Therefore, somewhere in the middle of the game will produce the idea: ""you can go there, but I want to go to another side on my side."" And here the thought creeps in that there is a choice. unfortunately, multiplayer left our vit along with GameSpy. The game is very addictive. Try it, you will be satisfied! P.S. If a soldier has a weapon dropped from his hands and he does not want to kill on his knees, do not drive !!! He will find a weapon and shoot you in the back !!! P.P.S.

It feels amazing and i'm doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else.

Anyway, in Times without Social Media or Internet we tried so many Stunts on them and the use of patches was very high. Godzilla was sometimes a little bit beastly, or i was too dumb for some stunts. Who knows? And yes, we also got a Film in that Times, called BMX BANDITS starring a very young Nicole Kidman. Good old 80´s. After that short not gaming Introduction, welcome to BMX-THE GAME.

As for the game itself, at such a situational price, one should therefore consider whether it is a pile of people thrown in our face with the slogan that it is free. The answer is contained in the first sentence. Yes, one can complain about technological roughness. The animations lack something, the fight is quite stiff, the opponents sometimes get convulsions after death as a result of an unfortunate collision with another object or it is simply raining in the cave. However, this does not prevent you from enjoying what is good in Two Worlds.

But the City is drowning in Chaos and Coldness. Panic, egotism, despair and death. That's what I missed in the movie. Even Snow and Ice were missing. The protagonist appears like a poor replica of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis. He appears formal, not authentic, as if he's plainly reading the script without adding any emotion to it.  The Prisoners (Rikers) however, operate way more authentic in comparison. I'm not too sure about the idea of seizing the game mechanics and somehow incorporate them into the film. Surely there could have been better alternatives to that, thinking of the trailer of ""The Division"", which put me unter it's spell immediatly. ",True,False

There is no real hassle of having sidequests since theres none really and there are 2 sides in which you have Paragon and Genocide which is up to you.

The game, graphically, is a visual delight, in addition, it is not very demanding in graphics, although not just any computer can run it, the requirements are not very high, more units were included, which is appreciated. With the DLC I feel a bit strange, it is not seen that they have put as much desire as they had previously done with, The Titans for example, some things seem recycled to me (Like the animation of the terracotta warrior, which resembles Gargarensis , or the Chinese Titan, which physically looks like the Nordic Titan) however, there are other things that I did like, such as what they added to the OST, it reflects a good setting, new units, a new UI (As it was to be expected, it is also well done), and regarding Bugs and lag I have not seen so much problem, since it came out until these days it has been seen how they have made an effort to make it playable and enjoyable. Something that still enchanted me, was that they kept the LAN mode, thanks to this, I have been able to remember those times of yesteryear as such, and I have been able to share it with close people. Anyway, despite everything it seems like a good game, highly recommended. ",True,False

Felp even fumbles with the law, indefatigable fighting a crime that has lost its roots even in the ranks of his colleagues. Arsons, raids of rocketeers, cruel murders, conspiracies - while unleashing a tangle of atrocities, a meticulous policeman will gradually pick up the most carefully guarded secrets of the criminal City of Angels.

You can play friends, you can play olo and bend over those who play friends (Yes, false, but more interesting). This game is proto devious. It only improves over time and turns into a masterpiece. Each patch introduces something new, something interesting. The developers try to please the players and make some variety. If you want to feel violent motions, to feel that yeast during replacements, raids, etc. then you have come to the right place.

583,"IN MY HONEST OPINION : -------------------------- Great game with amazing co-op. Requires too much focus so sometimes it becomes hard to play for fun,it does surpass L4d2's co-op in term of difficulty by miles,although it's very hard at first but once you get used to it,it does make you feel OP as the time passes. The community is a problem though, in recruit and veteran difficulties,people aren't toxic and salty but once you jump into random champion and legend difficulty games,you'll most probably be instantly kicked after 5 mins or even right after joining,the biggest joke are the ""Locally hosted servers"" in a game which is HEAVILY based on co-op,if you live somewhere really far then forget getting a decent ping (until or unless you're the host),not only this,the hosts would also occasionally rage quit in the middle which resets the whole level progress making the level to start from beginning again. Another BIG problem is the unbalanced enemy AI hordes which appear out of thin air,I'm not talking about them coming out of cracks of the walls or floor,they literally appear out from plain walls and sometimes even walk in air above your head. Some of the rpg style elements of the game are really interesting though,like getting different gear,weapons,skill points just by playing the game,five heroes in total and each one having their different sub classes which gives you more of a variety to select from,although some heroes are obviously OP then others,quite like moba games. Would I recommend this game to everyone? Yes I will,if cons are ignored (which is really hard to do in this particular game). I still enjoy this game but not more then L4d2,no game beats the fun co-op of that game. I gave it a negative review before because of ""local only servers"" but imma reconsider my choice and not act to harshly with it cuz it's still the most fun melee focused game I've played yet and it's a good challenging time killer (also kills you from the inside everytime when some bs happens).

674,"Don't be fooled by the deadline. I play the game ps vitada and am almost halfway. I played the game for 24 hours. Trails in Sky is actually a trilogy. This game is called ""first chapter"" shortly as ""fc"". Then, after the second chapter, the third chapter comes. Even if I don't know wrong, there is a save transfer event. Isn't it interesting? A jrpg and save export. You can also deduce that you have to play this series in turn. There is only a situation like this. The ""trails"" series does not end when the 3rd chapter ends. The trails in sky trilogy ends. It still has Cold Steel Azure & Zeros. Therefore, if you are going to start the series, I suggest you go in the following order. I will do that. FC -> SC -> 3rd -> Zero -> Azure -> CSI -> CSII -> CSIII -> CSIV CS by Cold Steel. Let's get to the game after giving this information. Trails in Sky is a classic turn-based jrpg that debuted in 2004. The order advancing from top to bottom on the left of the screen shows who has the attack order. It happens that he sometimes writes critical, ep 50%, cp 10% besides the person or enemy whose turn it is. These are simply bonuses. There is no random encounter in the game. Even this is a plus in itself. Our main character Estelle receives a surprising gift from her father at the beginning of the game. Of course, what kind of gift is this for his father? Estelle also wants to be ""Bracer"". Bracer money problem solver. We can say that it is a kind of mercenary. In order to be a bracer, it is necessary to pass written practical exams at various stages. The game does not force you in this regard. It doesn't even force it at all. After a little mission, you get bracer. He progresses more on this in the game. You can take various missions from bulletin boards in bracer guilds or go directly to the main scenario. My advice is to do these tasks as much as possible. Small missions, mostly guild missions, such as killing creatures, escorting or finding something lost. Of course, not all of them are like that. They have different missions among them. You may think, ""I will move forward in the main scenario, and do these tasks towards the end of the game"". Unfortunately, the game does not offer you such an opportunity. These are the missions that are canceled after a certain stage. You may go to the bulletin board and see an expired text next to an advertisement that you have never seen. If you want to avoid money problems, you should do these tasks. Do not worry, there are not many of these tasks. In the prologue part, there were 8 or 10 or so. I stated above that the game is turn-based. What you need to be careful about here is to hit the enemy as unnoticed as possible. Thus, you will both earn the right to hit the first hit and get double exp bonus. The opposite can be really troublesome sometimes. Based on the amount of time I've played so far, I can say that you shouldn't spend too much time with enemies. Just fight once to add to the monster notebook if you encounter a new enemy, and when you look at the enemy by saying details during the fight? analyze if any. We can compare the system of the game to the Material system of Final Fantasy 7. Similar logic but slightly different and more detailed. Already the game gives a tutorial about it. The system works as follows; As you kill the enemy, various orbs fall from these enemies. You go to shops called Orbal Factory and open slots thanks to these orbs and you throw various abilities there such as attack 2, hp 1 etc. Or, using these orbs, you can create skills such as defense 1, hp 2, and then assign them to the slots you open. You can also monetize these orbs if you want, but I wouldn't recommend. Don't do it unless you're stuck with a lot of money. To talk about the characters, our main character Estelle Bright is a tsundere. He approaches events more emotionally than logical. Her half-brother Joshua is the opposite of Estelle. But I have to point out that it's about Joshua. Estelle's father and Joshuan don't have any blood ties. (If the game reverses about this in the future, it is a separate issue, which is not mentioned in the review) Speaking of Estelle's father, it would not be if we do not mention him. Caius Bright. Living legend in the game. You will hear a lot of different characters in the game that are very powerful, incredibly talented, literally the definition of perfection. Even our teacher in the Bracer guild is a student of Caius. Almost every character in the game has a personality. Some people like to fish, some are watching the stars at night and dreaming, others try to get what they want by using their position, etc. etc. So talk to anyone you can talk to. They can also give you good tips. At the beginning of the review, I mentioned that I played the game vitada. The reason for this is entirely due to the voiceover. And the voiceover is really good. Let me give you good news, they have adapted it to PC. With a little research, you can find it. I have to mention that I haven't tried it. My score for the game for the part I've played so far is 87. I guess that it will get a close score when the game is over, looking at its course. ",True,False

694,"The Silent Age is a game which I started with low expectations, and ended up being quite impressed with it. It is a Point & Click adventure game with time travel mechanics, in which the main character can change between two different time periods. Sometimes it is required that you go back to the past, gather an item from the past, take it with you to the future, and solve a puzzle to progress through the story. With this gameplay mechanic, Silent Age becomes a very unique game. The game's visually beautiful with simplistic artstyle, which can vary from very colorful and vivid in the past, and very dreadful in the future since it's a post-apocalyptic world. The simple visuals do lower the difficulty of the game in general. It's easy to notice which items need to be picked up or interacted with, making the puzzles not that hard but still fun to crack. The game's pacing is well done, due to the fact that most of the puzzles are intuitive if you're paying attention to details. While that may be a turn off for some people, I like the idea of basic puzzles to keep the story going, while still being engaging from chapter to chapter. There are 10 chapters in The Silent Age, each chapter feels unique and not repetitive at all. Chapter 10 does have a bit of backtracking in the beginning though. I've played a fair share of Point & Click games in my lifetime, and this became one of my favorites. The story is great since I'm a sucker for time travel and dark themes, the visuals are simplistic yet gorgeous in it's way, the voice acting is above average and believable and the ambient sounds in an almost non-existent soundtrack helps to set up the atmosphere of The Silent Age. The value of the game is subjective (as always), but I'd say 10€ is worth it if you are into Point & Click adventures and Time Traveling mechanics, although it is a short game and shouldn't take more than 3.5 hours to complete. 8/10 ",True,False

708,"As someone who is not fond of horror or point & click games, Fran Bow was a pleasant surprise. From its unsettling atmosphere, to the array of intriguing characters, everything in Fran Bow is clearly a labour of love. The artstyle is the first thing I fell in love with. It immediately reminded me of the intro sequence to Alice: Madness Returns. The animations are well done, and remain consistent through the entire game. The game uses a lot of gore, but it's not just any gore. It's artistic gore. That's right, the gore in this game is artistic gore. Rather than feeling disgusted, the gore in Fran Bow made me want to take a closer look at the screen out of interest, something no other game except for LISA has compelled me to do. The music in Fran Bow is well done. Nothing much to say about it, other than it is good enough to be worth purchasing the Original Soundtrack DLC. Now, the thing that really gripped me: the gameplay. Yes, it's your average point & click in terms of control and inventory. However, one mechanic stood out: the pills. Fran can take pills to see and enter an alternate reality. You may take pills and subdue their effect at any time. The images, objects, and beings you see from taking pills, are often quite quite disturbing, but in a good way. You will need to use the pills to solve puzzles, so they provide more than just interesting imagery. For Legend of Zelda fans, think of it as the Magic Mirror from Link to the Past that allows you to travel to the Dark World. Now, the question most people wonder: Are there jumpscares? The answer is yes and no. There are sudden popups, such as a character popping from behind a door you are about to enter, or heads falling from a staircase into the room. However, Fran Bow does not use the cheap tactics games such as Five Nights at Freddy's utilize. Nothing pops out at the screen at you. Without spoiling too much, I can confidently say that this game is indeed unsettling and in a way, scary, but the ""jumpscares"" are the lesser of evils this game brings. In terms of replay value, there is not much. This is a game I most likely will not play again unless I want to head back to hunt achievements. It took me around 8 hours to do a complete runthrough, though it probably will be much shorter for those who use a walkthrough or are generally excellent at noticing small details in point & click games. Despite its lack of replay value, my single playthrough was definitely worth both the money and time spent on this thought-provoking masterpiece. ",True,False

You can plunder villages and create a reputation for her as a mean pidora, or, on the contrary, you can be even and brave, paa villages from the raids of ravaged Uzbeks, you can also create a howl and capture the countries of Calradia one by one, the more often you occupy.

A nicer way to advance than just the linear. + Cinematic zoom-in, for dramatic effect, similar to that of fallout nv/3. + First person full body render, details matter. - Engine hasn't aged well, looks a little scruffy. - Stuttering isn't great, seems the animations are also capped at 30fps. - Hud looks very poor quality, though not all of it looks bad. - Your guns get removed after each chapter, (not a fan of this at all). - Enemies have over-the-top range/accuracy, shotguns especially annoying.  Call Of Juarez is the 1st game in sequence of stories told through the classic western lense. What i specifically like about this game is the way the story is told through perspective, one character going after another, but both played by the player in the 1st person, not many games experiment with this style of 1st/3rd person story telling, and i think it works really well. one of the better series of games to showcase the atmosphere in a gritty, but fair light. mixed in to myth and ideals of what it was like, through a ficticious storyline. From gameplay to narrative it plays well. what i really like is the lack of a health regen, in-place is a tonic based health drop system where you have to find them in the world, though they are not too rare, you often don't know where the next one is, so you have to strategically approach each encounter/mass encounter with a bit of caution. The suspense is nailed in COJ in a way most other Fps games fail at. Overall this game is one of the strongest in the series, for what it lacks in visual fidelity it makes up for in story, and gunplay. Well worth picking up, on sale or not.

Earlier, to play in the living room on the big screen, I had to unplug a lot of cables, put up with the PC and reconnect everything (replay of entertainment after the fun was over). Terribly bothersome. Now I have a tiny device (Steam Link) permanently connected to the TV in the living room and when I want to play there, I only disconnect the wireless receiver of the Xbox 360 controller from the PC, connect it to Steam Link in the living room and run ... Steam Link in the living room I ONLY connected to the network WiFi 5 Ghz and, surprisingly, the quality is brilliant. Streaming 1080p image without any smudging, pixelation, etc. at 60fps with no drops (Project CARS only had drops to 45fps but I'm not sure if it was a problem of the game itself running on ultra). In the settings I have marked that ""Bandwidth"" is used ""No limit"", however, when working on WiFi, the device uses 30MBit / s (maybe after connecting with an ethernet cable this value would be higher, but if at 30MBit / s the quality is very good / ideal, it is not I can see the need to run the cable from the router to the Steam Link all over the living room). I tested Steam Link on: Project Cars (works great) Batman Arkham Knight (works great ... i.e. working with Steam Link because the game itself is one big problem) CoD Black Ops III (no problems - I'm not a fan of FPS games with the pad so I turned on only Free Run) Killing Floor 2 (has full support for the controller, but I do not recommend this game on the gamepad. The game started and worked flawlessly) The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (works great) Dragon Ball Xenoverse (works great) Naruto Shippuden UNS 3 Full Burst (works great) GTA V (problems starting the game - always - you have to go to the PC and click the GTA V icon to maximize the game on the screen ... if you manage to start the game it works very well) Dying Light (works great) Goat Simulator ( works great) Life is Strange (works great) GRID 2 (works great) The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (the same as with GTA V, the game minimizes after switching on, you need to approach the PC and restore it after what the game works without problems) Magicka 2 (Steam Link I think was created for this game ... or vice versa) Worms Clan Wars (works great) Edit. Working Steam games continued: - Dirt 3 Complete Edition - Works great. Stem Link is useful for playing on the big screen in split screen mode (couch co-op) - GRID 2 and GRID: Autosports - same as Dirt 3 Additionally, Steam Link is very good at detecting non-Steam games (added to Steam library). I fired games from the Origin platform: - Star Wars: Battlefront (2015) - Crysis 3 - Mass Effect 3 - Dragon Age: Inquisition - Titanfall and they all worked fine. You just have to remember to turn off the ""enable Origin in game"" option in the Origin application settings. It seems to me that if a non-Steam game is launched on PC using the Steam application (""Add a non-Steam game"" option), it will also work via Steam Link. Generally, there are problems with launching games if it has an additional launcher before starting it, e.g. in TES: Skyrim selecting the Cinema or Full version. If you do not have a mouse connected to Steam Link (you use the pad itself), unfortunately you can not do anything because when the game itself and Steam Big Picture are minimized / fall into the background behind the launcher, the pad stops responding: / (I have hope in the future you will be able to move the Windows pointer with a regular controller - I don't know what it is like with the Steam Controller).

773,"Described as an ""occult adventure game"", a quick glance at Zelle's trailer will put you in no doubt that this is a strange game. You play as Emerada, imprisoned by a reaper in a giant ye olde castle. As far as I can tell, most of the game is set in the surrounds of the castle, and perspective shifts from top-down view to first-person view when Emerada's engaged in combat. The nitty gritty of how it plays seems a bit beside the point though, because the art style is fascinatingly grim and garish, terrifying and heartwarming. Looks like one for fans of Yume Nikki and similar.  Zelle is a horror adventure centering around exorcising the demons that try to attack you. It's not for everyone. With a broad blend of themes and gameplay elements, terms like horror or puzzle are just too narrow to describe it, but each element helps punctuate an intriguing story and pull you in deeper. It should take 3 - 4 hours to finish a playthrough and doesn't seem overly challenging, but it really is an engaging and surreal experience.  What more can I say ? An absolute gem! Never played anything quite like it.  Beautiful and surreal horror. To say anything more would take away from the experience,  but I really enjoyed it. <(^_^)> IMO: 06/10 PTS Greetings your CGH-Team~ ",True,False

There's even a way to, guess what.. slow down the gameplay to be more careful and less fast paced so you can practice! Ultimately there's a way to play exactly how you want as you get into it, if you just give it the time. Now, I know rogue-likes might not be for everyone but do understand all of them get easier the more you play and the more you understand. Even if you don't like the rogue-like style it simply means it's more difficult early on but it *will* get easier and you will get to play however you want by the end of it, which is simply amazing and makes it worth coming back to whenever you want to get another fun run in.

The building mechanisms are not that complex so it's very easy to learn (although I'm sure that hard-core simulation fans would probably want more variety of buildings).

Most of the enjoyment comes from the games not so subtle commentary on EA, microtransactions, day 1 DLC, Map packs and other 'trends' totally killing and retarding our beloved gaming industry currently. DLC Quest takes shots at a lot of popular franchises including FF7, COD, TF2 and of course Pay to Win games. References ranging from random nods to downright brutal observations, that will, if you're smart enough, leave you questioning your position on some of your favorite games and developers. The game plays like Super Mario. Essentially a simple side scrolling platformer. The Princess is taken by the bad guy at the start of the game and by purchasing DLC you can unlock content that allows you to finish the game. It's not a question of if you have the skill to complete the game. It's a question of if you are smart enough to understand what it's trying to highlight. Most of you won't like it. There isn't a Season Pass available. ",True,False

872,"I really enjoyed The Park. I was nervous with not being a fan of horror in general, but I have to admit this was a strong title for telling a short story about a mother reliving her past while struggling with her present situation. The game feels simple in design, you explore a park with 6 locations, which you can explore in no-particular order, and then a maze-like area serving as the game's finale. I highly advise following the narrative in the order that locations ""present"" themselves for the story to make the most sense. Basically, you can wander on your own, but I think it may actually harm your playthrough if you choose to do so.  I don't want this to come across as pretentious, but I think it's insanely brave of a game to talk about postpartum depression in such a forward way. The game is far more than that, but I think my review would be lacking if I did not say that. The voice actress for the character of Lorraine did such a fantastic job that I tried to find every single note just to hear more of the tone and presentation Fryda Wolff brought to the table. Andrew Kishino's role of the Bogeyman was intensely creepy and well done as well. I'm not at all familiar with The Secret World game via first-hand experience, but from my knowledge prior to and subsequent research after playing The Park I'm led me to believe there's far more going on than what can be seen during this game's events.  In any case, I think this is a really cool experience, even for people who don't like the horror scene like I do or amusement parks which I do not either. The rides are not sickening, but they are intense enough to feel real enough for the sake of the game. I thought they added a charm and misery to an already fear-driven story. The roller coaster in particular is an extremely well executed set piece both in narration and visual spectacle. I'm sure duration is a worry for players and while I think The Park could have been a bit longer and more details about the land and park's true purpose and the ending could have been more clear, and more robust, I still think it was enough to say the whole experience is extremely worth embarking on. It's entirely up to you though if you want to take a walk in The Park. ",True,False

To evolve and troit, something is always interesting and exciting. if your boiling depends on it, then it is not only interesting, but also useful. 4) Craft. Crafting in that game will come, well, a lot and a lot. 5) Baruk the killer. Here I think you can not explain. Minuy: 1) Large open world. This is usually a plus, but in the wrong game. The world, though big, is almost indistinguishable from the location in which it teaches you to run after 4-5 hours of gameplay. 2) Graphics. The graphics did not improve by equal to 4 parts, but somewhere they ate it. Soapy otriovka pretends. 3) The plot. There is no plot as such. After completing the quick tutorial, Wa will have access to about 20 ""southern"" tasks and monotonous id queues based on the principle of guiding / killing / lusting. 4) ntagonite. As such, it is not in this game. There are of course Ull and Batari, but they clearly do not pull on the heads of reptiles. 5) The domestication of animals. Idea is certainly good, but it was implemented very poorly ... You just throw the cook ma on the ground and wait for the animal to come running to him. After that you just need to press the button. For 50 hours of the game, I did not have a single ray, which showed that the beast showed that he was a beast and did not subjugate it to taming. 6) Dybalan weapons. There are so few weapons in the game, but they still made it playable only with a spear that one-shot almost all enemies ...

But do not worry, even if the game does not come up with a completely new plot and incredibly surprising plot twists, it manages to bring a breath of fresh air to these old, dusty topics. This eerily beautiful point'n'click adventure in wood relief optics takes you straight into a kind of medieval feverish dream that is just as beautiful as it is terrible. The graphic style uses a matching color palette in dark wood tones and the animations are a bit cumbersome at first glance, but they fit perfectly into the overall concept. The 12-track soundtrack once again underlines the gloomy medieval atmosphere, which, apart from the cutscenes, which are excellently set to music by (guitarist and singer of the Polish metal band), does not need any text or language. Torture devices, monsters, symbolism and the (but) belief of the time are perfectly inserted into the puzzles, which have a pleasant level of difficulty. Most can be solved quickly and intuitively and are not unfair on any point. For one or the other mini-game, however, you need a little practice or skill to unlock the respective achievement.

1108,"Of course, everyone will compare with the remake of the second game, but we need to go back in time and think about the reality of the original Resident Evil 3 (which also proved to be weak compared to the original RE2). The franchise slowly lost its character as the son of ""Alone in the Dark"" and was taking on the face of something much more action oriented (which ends up culminating in the disastrous Resident Evil 6). But despite all that, the more numbered titles, the more targeted any franchise will be, see Final Fantasy for example. The reason for pointing out all this is so that you have a parameter when looking at the reasons for other negative or positive analyzes of this game. I believe that although much more linear than the previous one, Resident Evil 3 Remake once again taking advantage of the successful graphic engine Reach For The Moon (RE Engine) presents a dynamic narrative that resembles in some aspects Resident Evil 7. The visual and effects sounds are chilling, but the pace is fast and little time is lost with puzzles in traditional mazes that require constant return and advance as if it were a metroidvania game. The game also sinks in the way the text files are presented as the newsroom often seems lazy, the good thing is that fans will have the benefit of accumulating more reformulated history with the inevitable stretches of retroactive continuity The gameplay is clearly geared towards , because precise dodges are rewarded with a slow motion visual response and the knife becomes virtually useless for the more casual player. Zombies seem more resilient than normal (which is reminiscent of classic games), but playing in the most casual difficulties will grant resources on a large scale so that you can play comfortably until the end. In the standard difficulty I had problems only with a single stretch in which a certain classic enemy is presented in the same way as in classic RE1 and proved to be as deadly as. The series may no longer use the classic tank controls, but this game has certainly found a way to frustrate in its combat, it is definitely an open card for everyone to learn that the only solution is escape ... Until the time the game forces you in impractical situations. The main antagonist of this game may seem to many simple and less terrifying than say Mr. X, but the truth is that unlike the villain of RE 2 Remake, Nemesis is a narrative tool, he is not there to pressure his reflexes but just to move the plot which is a walk through Raccoon City. We are not dealing with a single closed scenario where the chase looks more like an episode of Scooby Doo, this time Nemesis is there to force you out of scene A to scene B and that's a good thing. The most important part is always the optimization that this graphic engine allows, the myriad possibilities in terms of customization are enviable and in most cases they do little harm to even the lowest machines. The game showed no flaws or errors that interrupted the experience and few that hindered the immersion. Resident Evil 3 will leave the audience divided, yes it is short and this has its merit, it is called identity, personality. It is a sign that the game is part of its own genre in the same way that RE 7 and RE2 Remake had their characteristics. But that does not mean that it will please everyone or that it deserves a prize of the year as it almost happened last year. Capcom may not have pleased Greeks and Trojans this time around, but it certainly hasn't played a disastrous game as some have been pointing out. I must also emphasize the quality of the value offered in Brazil. A high budget game (which includes yet another completely different mode) for 130 reais, made in just 1 year is of incredible value and Capcom is probably the only company currently offering this even with the economic crisis and the dollar worth 5 reais. Consider all this. -------------------------------------------------- ---------------- ",True,False

The Bosses are based off of characters from real cartoons and even real people!   took their sweet time with this, and our wait was most definetly our benefit.

The mechanics of this game are so smooth and so seemless. The controls are so basic on controller and on keyboard that playing is fair game for most people.   I could also argue that this game would be appealing to older audiences but also younger (Dependant on age and Parental Controls) Older audience can reflect on the old time music and visuals depending on their era and younger audiences will enjoy this game because of the visuals the music but most importantly the challenges and the CARTOON-ish vibe. Now lets discuss the dificulty of this game.  recommend you to play this game if you don't have the time to play. I can assure you this game takes time and patience so I suggest you play this game when you have time. The bosses patterns take time to master because of the multiple stages that each boss has, so this takes time to master and execute. They continue to get harder through the Islands but nothing anyone couldn't handle with a little bit of time.

Events are constant with a new one coming out largely every week and there are always bonuses and loot to be had all the time. Though not perfect (what game is?) the game is constantly being updated and improved. Support is excellent with conservative timing of a response within a couple of hours. The last time I played a game with so much content was back in the 90s on MUDs, a definite must for RPG / MMO players, especially with the price being so low for the game! I should also point out this is not a P2W game like so many others before it. Sure there is an in-game shop where you can essentially buy items which you can market for silver, but in order for this to be anywhere near cost effective you'd be spending thousands in cash. I'm sure there are a select few that would probably do this but for the vast majority it just isn't in the slightest practical by any stretch.

1131,"So Chainsaw Warrior is definitely fantastic... if you played the board game. It is pretty much a perfect recreation of the game with some added value like no shuffling or card management and easy/medium modes. Even on easy where you get a thumb on the scales for your stat rolls and you get to choose your equipment, it's not guaranteed that you'll make it through to kill The Darkness. You might hit the chasm, not have a rope launcher or the climbing skill and have to backtrack out of the building and lose time. The wretched lunatic might steal your IR goggles or, god forbid, your chainsaw. You might fail a reflex roll and break equipment in a fall. There are a lot (!) of ways to fail. And hard mode, which is the pure board game form, is brutal. Satisfyingly brutal. Killing The Darkness on hard is a nice mix of good choices and good luck. Having played and loved the game once upon a time, it's hard for me to peek out from behind my nostalgia colored glasses (for us children of the 80's, it's probably a Miami Vice pastel...) to know whether to recommend the game to folks without that tie to the past. The game is certainly fun, but there is a certain amount of clicking through mob zombies en route to more interesting cards that's not especially exciting after the first 50+. And a lot of the game is watching what unfolds. There are actual player decisions to be made, but not every turn. A lot of times you are sort of reacting to what the cards have in store for you. It's almost a randomized adventure game in that sense. And the mechanics are a bit unbalanced. Shooting requires a reflex check to even be able to fie and has limited ammo whereas hand to hand is one roll. If you play on Easy, take the Chainsaw. :) It's a great version of a great old board game. Hard as nails, patently unfair, good for a quickie 20-30 minute gaming session and deeply satisfying when on hard with randomized equipment you make your reflex check and shoot that smug prick The Darkness in the face.

1180,"Before entering the Golden Axed: A Canceled Prototype mini-game, you are greeted with a warning that there may be bugs in the game, and the game is not a game, but a couple of levels of a long-canceled game. I will introduce how some SEGA fans are jumping from the votorg from such a sudden legal prize, but unfortunately it doesn't tell me much. And the first moments are clear that in the middle of the 2000s we have stripped something skinny, which would definitely set a certain tone in the genre of kshen-platformers. Themselves bugs, which were not warned, did not come across, but there were certain inconveniences. For example, it’s starting out that it’s a demo, not a game, just because we need to push the controls in a separate zapuka file. At the same time, if we talk about the gameplay, the peronage sometimes rests on opponents and misses with a blow past them. Oh, it's not a big deal, because the passage of the mini-game will take no more than 10 minutes, and the game process will finish before you really start. The play was great, and the action and the beautiful design of the first level give a clear understanding of what that game could get. ",True,False

1262,"Surely fans of the franchise like me, when playing the other games asked the same question that many are asking themselves now, is this game Resident Evil? For the game had neglected many of the classic game mechanics that made it so famous. In addition it has become a linear game, which you start in a scenario full of enemies and you just have to go forward and kill the enemies, until you reach the end. Resident Evil 4 until it went well, revolutionizing the entire gaming industry and became a mirror for many other games that followed, but Capcom increasingly moved away from the essence that had taken the franchise to such a level. Then came Resident Evil 5 which for me is by far the worst of the franchise, its only innovation was to add the co-op and end Albert Wesker's story, then came Resident Evil 6 which is by far the most hated game of the whole franchise, because the fans had already lost patience, and got together to complain directly to Capcom, who seeing all this commotion finally decided to do something about it, and that’s exactly what Capcom got attached to in order to make their next game of the franchise, and that's when the trailer for Resident Evil 7 appeared with the controversial first-person camera and double-meaning phrases that drove fans crazy, such as: She is back and Welcome home. Some (like me) thought that the game would not match the camera in the first person, and were on the defensive wondering ""is it really that She is back?"" (is the franchise back yet?), others have already embarked on the one-way hype train, even more after playing the demo that Capcom provided and seeing that some classic mechanics were back. Just like in the classic games of the franchise, now a completely new character named Ethan Winters who is completely inexperienced and unprepared is put in a dangerous situation when he discovers that his wife Mia Winters missing and considered dead 3 years ago is actually alive (She is back) and send an email to pick him up at a farm in Dulvey, Louisiana. But to find out what happens next, then you will have to find out for yourself. The only thing I can say is that Resident Evil 7 has a very good storyline, with suspense, many discoveries and twists. This game, different from the last games in the franchise, I didn't expect much, but the game surprised me a lot, reinforced my confidence in Capcom, and brought a real chance to appear as indicated for the game of the year, even if it is in some category. It also left that taste of: What's up, will there be more? Congratulations Capcom, for the incredible game you have made, proving that Resident Evil can still remain great.

Otherwise, you will get tired of that game quite quickly and it will go on the shelf to SonicX, Mario and other projects that have not been interesting to anyone for a long time.

1338,"Ah Elite Dangerous... It truly is one of the most alluring, immersive and satisfying space sims I've come across in my time.   The ""Space Simulation"" game genre is often so hard to get right because the topic is so incredibly vast and mysterious that it is impossible for someone to create a perfect and accurate representation of what really is going on out there.  But it should be noted that the developers did an outstanding job to provide you with an accurate taste of what it could actually be like, in terms of interplanetary travel, earning a wage in space, and more. Elite provides much more of a hardcore simulation based experience rather than what many would consider casual and fun, so it may not be for everyone. For those of you who do decide to take on the journey, you will find that it is a truly deep and realistic space sim which focuses mainly on space combat, trading, and exploration. Some of the things that can be done include, warping through space, landing on planets, mapping/exploring new star systems, trading, mining asteroids, collecting bounties, delivering passengers and more. The graphics and especially the sound in Elite Dangerous are really something else. All of this adds to such a great realistic and immersive experience that I wish many more people could see. Elite also has its fair share of difficulties that lie within. For example, you will find that Elite it is not very ""welcoming"" to newer players. It often leaves them with more questions than answers. This can be rather bad because it can turn off many potential players that would otherwise have enjoyed their time with the game. You would also expect that such a space oriented game would have a deep and accessible customization system for ships, but unfortunately this is another place where Elite lacks. Another thing Elite is heavily missing, are planetary cities and things of this nature. Because of this, roaming and exploring the galaxy can seem rather boring at times because you know you won't find anything too amazing or impressive.These are just a few of the things that I found worth mentioning. It may not be perfect, but I've chosen to recommend Elite Dangerous because it still accomplishes a simulation's main purpose, which is to provide a player with a realistic and immersive experience. Although it may not be for everyone, I'm glad to have experienced and been apart of it. I look to see what the future of Elite Dangerous holds in store for us. I think it will be worth the wait.

Driving etiquette Traffic rules that must be kept at all times It is encouraging that you have to control a car with a lot of options. Especially the speed that has to be a headache every time you accidentally drive a fast car and have to pay a rather harsh fine. Do not forget that driving is not like driving a normal car. Because of the shape that is high The weight of the source said I have to come to a product that is 15-25 tons. I accidentally drive a tired e Obviously, it has to be tough and challenging in itself. But that is the support of it. And don't rush to come too because you can Save Game at any time all the time. - Money, Money, Money: This is important money and is a factor of this menu because it is used both to buy a car, hire a driver, upgrade. Buy a car and a garage, pay for gas, repair, this is all. During the beginning of the episode, you will find yourself playing hard because of the heat of money. I have to think, think whether it is worth the money or not - Level system: There is a little RPG, every level can be up to 1, Tiltsil is useful to ah. Make all money Level Ye is more challenging and requires patience to play. But Ee, by earning money for example - all over Europe: only in Europe, Eastern Europe. The coming part will be all expressways. Driving on a long straight road, with some turns, and some brakes, the road may not be equivalent to the real thing. But the surrounding atmosphere and proportion It is a real thing that took pictures. - Mod support: It is a simulator that does not support Mod. Who wants to try the skin or make it easier to adjust the graphics can be downloaded on the web (not available in Steam Workshop) above all is Key features of this menu The writing is long and quite detailed. Let's conclude that day (+) is a realistic simulation of Driving Simulator. All driving and (+) new map, the route is not equivalent to the real one But the atmosphere is real (+), I can't hurry to come back to play now, save somewhere (+) If I play it, it will become instantly melted.

I didn't work with anyone. If hoping to drive the police No one, don't expect (-) if there's a economic system too.

1365,"So what is Terraria? This is a 2D open-world sandbox platformer. Before starting a new game, you can customize his character and the level to which he will fall. However, only one parameter is subject to change - size. But the ward can be decorated as you like, however, the process is not implemented in the most convenient way. Instead of a specific choice of color, we are offered to adjust the RGB scale and observe the result. There is no plot here, because the field of ""birth"" your protege is free to do whatever. There is definitely something to stop here. First, the hero needs a home. To build a house you need reurs, and to extract reurs you need tools. Initially, the tools are a village ax and a village pick. Unlike Minecraft, in Terraria they do not break, and the village pickaxe differs from the silver pick only by the short, with which it crushes stone and other blocks. Extraction and processing of reur trot according to standard heme - we chop wood with an ax, stone, minerals and ore we break with a pick. The field of which successfully obtained can be used in construction, melted down or used as an ingredient. The chilo of crafting recipes is huge - more than in Minecraft, several times. However, your manufacturing process has been greatly simplified. In order to do something, it is enough to have the ingredients with you and, having selected the necessary item in the inventory menu, just put it somewhere. to use, for example, a furnace or an anvil, you need to go to it. This makes life easier for the player, because there is no need to wait for the ore to be melted into a metal casting, or to memorize unnecessary information about recipes, or to follow the otony of its narzheni.

1375,"2017’s   wasted no time in setting the gaming world alight, both with its unique approach of being an “independent AAA game, and for its treatment of mental health in the player-character, the titular Senua.  It’s a credit to developer Ninja Theory, that Senua’s psychosis is much more than a gimmick; it’s a core gameplay mechanic, it drives the whole story, and it is a part of her. She’s not a sexy badass warrior; she’s scared and overwhelmed, and the game’s stunning visual and sonic work constantly drives home how much of an uphill climb her journey is, which makes for an engrossing and compelling gaming experience. Combat is a welcome relief from the unrelenting mental assault, but also the game’s only weak spot. Too many times, I was backed into a corner, with the camera either becoming obscured, or so zoomed in as to be ineffective. It felt less like a metaphor for Senua’s psychosis, and more like a symptom of bad design. However, even in its simplicity (no distracting HUD or health bar), the combat is satisfying in its own right; after a barrage of auditory hallucinations challenging everything you do, hacking a monstrous VIking apparition into oblivion feels like an accomplishment.   is an intensely thought-provoking game that doesn’t overstay its welcome; and on the rare occasions that it overplays its cards (either with the constant barrage of cues that scream THIS IS A GAME ABOUT MENTAL DISORDER, or the ending), it’s well-deserved.

1387,"If you put this question right now, you will be able to get the answer in an instant, but if the advancement of science and technology is reached, the robot has already gotten close to humans, and even some of them have surpassed humans. Can you simply tell the difference at this time? You are set in such a future full of Cypunk style. Our male protagonist is a cartoonist who specializes in drawing robots. The visit of a robot maid one day disrupts his ordinary life...Zaihe Weiyu’s robot maid In the days when they get along, the male protagonist uses her as a prototype to take a comic test. They will also play games together, go shopping together, and discuss the relationship between humans and robots. And the rain like a mile also took care of the male lead, as if he was a cold robot in every move. But high-intelligence robots have also caused some people in the society to panic. They are afraid that robots will take their jobs, and fear that robots are better than humans. So the robot pair appears. The male protagonist’s neighbor is one of them. And he seems to be eyeing Yu... The most shocking truth is that Yu is actually dressed up as a human, and his father seems to be an executive of the robot man, Yu can choose to run away from home for some reason. What's more unexpected is that the male protagonist is also a robot that has always pretended to be human. . Obviously the hero of the robot, he will always draw humanoid comics, and the robot maid Yu, disguised by humans, has deceived the eyes of good individuals. It is also the difference between the two people who are laughing and laughing, as if telling The difference between us, robots and humans is actually not as big as we thought. The most important thing is whether there is a heart that brings warmth to each other. You tell the story of a cartoonist and a ""machine maid,"" but the story is described and displayed very well. The production team wants to express the theme of ""the difference between humans and robots, and the ending turn seems to be in this even the player I can't even see the difference between humans who try to disguise robots and robots who try to disguise humans. The difference between them is what humans call robots. But obviously there is such a profound script and such a large exhibition space, and the plot seems blunt and terrible. First of all, the hostess’s family background is only quickly brought up by the news on TV. We know that the hostess can run away because of the family conflict, but the description of this party is only a brief summary. Make bigger swings based on it. Of course, it was about the fuzzy feelings between the male and female lords. After playing, I couldn't figure out whether it was love or affection. The two people's ignorant ambiguity and accompany each other during the whole process completely made me feel that they were birds of each other in the rainstorm, just because of interest. And when it comes to the end, they are mutual expressions, but they continue to support each other and live for each other, but this so-called emotion is quite blunt, and the forced turn makes people feel uncomfortable. Even personally feel that the male lead is knowing the truth, and it is often wise to ask a girl who has run away from home and choose the way to leave her behind. The most plastic is a society where the technology is so high that humans as owners are panicked. It looks like robots are humans, but in fact there are conflicts and human parades. Military robots have the power to directly harm humans, and even the wrong police will be arrested. , But it is such a utopian cyberpunk social background. The tour is only superficial, and did not continue to explore these deeper issues. Instead, it is always said that robots and humans are big, as if they are serving the plot. , A totally related worldview. ""Remembrance of the Machine"" is a story about the manga hero taking in the robot maid Yuzhisheng under the cyberpunk world view. Although there are exquisite CG and fascinating worldview, the plot and the foreshadowing are often bad, and there are comparatively expensive countries GAL Higher prices and short duration, cost-effective.

1436,"There are many different games in the Tower Defense style, but BARRICADEZ takes a fresh look at that genre. From the very beginning, the game pleases with a picture, it means to separately praise the artists for full-time shots, and in general, the details are drawn at the highest level. Zavzka begins with the fact that there is no one on Earth except robots and zombies, in ruins, full of chao and despair. Suddenly, a capsule lands in the sky as a child. She is found by a robot surviving in that mess, for which we are to play in order to protect the poor man from the insatiable crowds of various monsters. The field of krachny zatavka is thrown into the hell, he will come to play a few times before you can ponte, how is it tripled here. This is a 2D game, for the protection of the capsule by the child, an extensive item of crafting (traps and protective weapons) and the extraction of reurs is provided, which is precisely the main feature of the game. The crafting system is so extensive that it will not be able to be easily disassembled in it, and given that the game is still in the early stage, the authors will probably add more possibilities in that component. It is impossible to kill your robot, he mentions it at the beginning of the game, so worry only about the person transferred to your care. I can’t fail to note the well-developed levels, which infinitely diversify the game. The atmosphere of BARRICADEZ is perfectly complemented by oppressive music and gloomy landscapes, adding a little feeling of desperation and despair. Immediately it is worth noting that the game is still in the early stage and it doesn’t mean to find fault with it, it can change many more times. Zde probably wants to point out what is missing in the game at the moment. The very first thing that strikes the eye is the lack of internal training or prompts of what to start and how to infringe in that world in general. From the first follows the second - you need a more intuitive interface in the item crafting, otherwise it comes to waste a lot of time in order to make out a little in the game options. Wish for the future: - adding the possibility of training, so that you can dig in the calm setting in the game, its possibilities, sweat certain possibilities; - harmonious development of the history in the southern plan; - improvement of the interface, to make it more intuitive, it may be necessary to add options for enabling prompts during the game process. BARRICADEZ is an interesting enough project to draw attention to it and track further development. It will be very interesting to find out what the Itori will end up with when the robot loses human life. ",True,True

1464,"I recommend this game if you play with your friends. I have an intense love / hate relationship with Dead by Daylight and feel like I've logged in enough hours to write an honest review. If you're just wondering here if the community is as toxic as everyone says it is. . . yes it is. I wouldn't say it's more or less toxic than the communities found in CS: GO, Overwatch, Fortnite, etc. . . but the post-game chat can definitely scare a new player. If you are new to the game, I highly recommend playing with one or more experienced friends who can train you. If you don't have thick skin or a lot of patience, playing solo right after you come off the stick can go crazy. Consequently, many people will only play with DbD when they play with their friends. And that's okay and completely fair. 4v1 gameplay is based on cooperation, and it cannot be guaranteed that a random player will have your backing. There was a time when I took this game very seriously, and she ruined it for a while. After the break I came back and swore that I would be playing just for fun, disconnecting from her when I felt like I was even getting a little salty or competitive. I'm mostly a killer, but I like to play survivors every once in a while. I think it's extremely important that every DbD player experiences the killer game. You'll have in-game and post-game toxicity when you survive, but nothing really prepares you for a post-game conversation when you're an assassin. I tend to minimize the conversation so I don't see it, or I change my username to something friendly (which nobody should do, but I'm a lover, not a fighter). While playing assassin can help thicken your skin against the community, it's really helpful for learning to be a better teammate while playing survivor. There is also a killer for everyone. While I want to be the best with every killer in the game, I succumbed to it being impossible for me and tried every killer until I found one that suited my playstyle. I have a lot of gimmicks about programmers and so do most gamers. Each update seems to fix something but break something else. The server lag is terrible, and lately, matchmaking is a complete joke (you should pick players at your skill level, but it's no longer unusual to be pushed into a lobby with players well below or well above your skill level). There are nice and gentle players in this game, and they really kept me around when I first started playing. I will never forget my first killer play in a public match. I was nervous and had a lot of fun. Post-game chat, a more experienced player encouraged me, ""You're a good killer - just watch your tracking."" They hung up and gave me some advice to exercise. Okay, every game that followed was toxic. . . but it made me try again. I try to reciprocate this to newer players when I can. ",True,False

1468,"Well, I mean, its a NFS game, it has cars that go fast. The main gimmick here is during the day you do legal racing to make money, and during the night you street race for rep to unlock new stuff with. Overall its really good. Stunning visuals, solid arcade style racing, boss soundtrack. Performance on my rig has been fantastic, though loading times are lengthy. The problem is the cops. They're just hella OP. At heat level 5 making a getaway is difficult due to helicopters, there's a constant stream of frustratingly precise cop cars that spawn in around you, there's spike traps and massive trucks that ram you for BIG damage. Even regular cop cars at that level easily derail you.  Worst of all they can killswitch your car, if this happens once with a bit of luck you can still get away but I've had occasions where multiple cop cars literally killswitch-chain my car at which point you get busted, game over, you lose all your progress from that night. You see, during the illegal night events you make rep, but to keep it you have to safely make it to a garage. If you get busted by cops everything you made during that night is lost, so the stakes are crazy high. On the one hand the cops often cross over into just infuriatingly overpowered territory, but then on the other I've never felt more exhilerated playing a racing game than when trying to hold onto my progress by evading a heat level 5 cop chase.

1476,"""Trail Explorer"" is a butter on behalf of a shrine. In 500 years, she was the first female adventurer who entered the trail ""Ladder of the Sky"", and she was cursed by the enchanted demon king during her journey deep in the trail-she and the surrounding monsters would forcibly enter the situation. In order to lift the curse, she went on a journey of the Demon King in the depths of the Ladder of Seeking with the intelligence merchant Weiss who had arrived outside the trail. Kuim found: The timeline in this trail is chaotic, and they are also involved. In the past, present and future events. For five years, Marianne has been looking for her husband Henry, who went to the ladder of heaven alone and never returned. Henry is a researcher, loves career as much as his own life. That One day, he decided to go to the ladder of heaven to finish his research. Although, looking at the light in her husband's eyes, she found that she was obstructed by herself. Marian and the child said goodbye to him. That was the first time she visited him. Kuim promised to help Marian go to the Ladder of the Sky to find her husband. But she brought back a book of research notes, telling all the sadness between the lines... The righteous thief Leebston was the most said. He and his bandit robbed the rich and helped the poor, benefited from the wealth, helped others, and loved and hated them. They were succumbed to the noble forces. But all the strange stories ended on that day-the bandit's net. For the lives of all the bandit, Liba Ston promised to get something for the expensive ladder to the sky. But until the end of the period, Libaston still failed to return, and all members of the righteous group were executed. He also got this: the tragic righteous thief. In the trail, he rescued the dying Lipaston, helped him get the property, and rescued the righteous group. Although Kuim changed the past, the story of Lipston ended in tragedy. ... Marie’s person, Franz, is an expensive one. And Franz, who is aloof, Mary was born a commoner, and this relationship is also an obstacle. They made an oath and waited for Franz to get to the sky. The tokens belonged to the two and they got married. Seeing Franz's figure disappeared on the horizon in the morning, Mary began to wait. The enthusiastic girl, she is always one. She climbed the city wall from the sky and looked into the distance along the thick stone. I hope that my beloved will ride a white horse, bring a group of people back, hand in the tokens and propose by myself. But hopeful waiting time and time again, all ended in disappointment. However, the next day, she will ignite new hope, thinking maybe, Maybe he will come back today. It was because I didn’t greet him at the door when he came back, he would be sad. This time, four years. The town’s horseshoes and footsteps, there are strangers in the streets, she thought it was him. I'm back. Wait and wait, how many spring, autumn and winter have been waiting, from the beginning of the day, Mary has also been from a slim girl to a dying woman. She has no one, and she believes that one day he will marry her again. Hospital bed On the above, Mary told Kuim her wish, hoping to return to that man on her deathbed. Kuim has been to Franz for four years, and he told her wish... She is The saint of the church, she guides the people, she is the elephant of hope. In the 99th year of the new Gregorian calendar, the church initiated a holy war against the dwarves. In the year 1999, the saint took her followers as messengers to the capital of the underground dwarves for peace talks: ""I am holding peace The heart of the negotiations, please let us pass here but the answer of the dwarves is the long sword With warhammer. The saint leads the believers to find a way out in the huge underground maze. ""Master Sherazet, we can do it. You are a saint who has been enshrined in the gods, and the path under your feet will be the right path."" ""There must be evil institutions, my lord, we can let you take risks , Or return to ""The only way to survive is progress."" After several trials, the fewer believers around the saint. At the end, there were two heartfelt followers by her side. ""This is the track that connects the destination we expect. Following the wind, we can reach the future we expect. Encouraged by the courage of the saint, the believers nodded vigorously. They are convinced that they are from Sheraze In the special language, I realized the true doctrine of the only existence and God. Most, the curse of the dwarves, the saint gave up the hope of surviving, and used her life to induce the most miracles. ""I will use my life."" , Heart and faith are offered as living sacrifices, and oath represents God to eliminate all evils in the world. Ask the Lord to take my body to your temple and show your handle through me. A miracle happened. The dwarves all received the curse, and the dwarf capital was reduced to ashes. This is the reason for the Saint Mary's Day in the record. On this day of the year, people cherished each other and missed the saint who dedicated herself to the Lord and the people. However, Kuim saw a period of history from the memory of trace. She and Weiss also understood the meaning of the saint. My name is Kuim, a female adventurer. My father often warned me when I went to the city of Ya, trying to find a way to enter the ladder of heaven, and said that we Kelitis had to bear the sins. But he never told me the original. In the third year of my father's death, I entered this site without him. Fortunately, I was cursed. To lift this curse, there is a way to defeat the devil. I am very grateful to my partner Weiss for her help, and I am very happy to live to this day. In the most area of ​​the ladder of heaven, I understood that my father's words were to protect me. I finally saw the essence of the ladder of heaven, my life experience, and why the dagger held by that trembling hand was pointing to me. Generally speaking, ""Trace Explorer"" is an often mistaken light Roguelike with maze and dungeon yuan horizontal version of ARPG butter. The framework of the world is based on the more common swords and magic. The swimming time is 5~7 hours, the difficulty is moderate, and it will be more difficult to play without high-level equipment. Boss is moderately difficult and particularly difficult to master. 1. The story goes beyond the game, and there are rich side lines to discuss tasks. 2. The combat system is wrong. When fighting, the strike feels comfortable. Weapons are divided into primary weapons and secondary weapons. The primary weapons are mostly cold weapons such as swords, axes, and halberds, and the secondary weapons are long-range weapons such as arrows, crossbows, and bombs. The types of weapons are often rich, and there will be external characteristics after strengthening, and there will always be a suitable one. 3. There are two ways to strengthen weapons: go to the shop and spend money to strengthen or start with weapons. Shop once to strengthen the two main weapons and secondary weapons worn on the body, and make a number of times to go to the maze to strengthen once; if the corresponding weapon is obtained in the shop or the maze, the weapon will be directly given the enhancement level of one. The weapon is strengthened to level 10. This mechanism greatly reduces the pressure of “swiping, and eventually the boss can get at least one powerful main weapon and secondary weapon with light. The experience is quite comfortable under the game. 4. The voice part is covered, and the story voice involved is fully covered. The sound and the sound are wrong. 5. The pictures and scenes are excellent. 1. You can read files in Youlifa. If you want to read files, you must exit the new download archive, which is very convenient. 2. The UI design is outdated. There is not even a button to exit the game. 3. On Kuim's body The state will cause a pause, but the monster will attack the player at this time. Exquisite vertical painting and L2D, character voice (complete) coverage, many H scenes, high text quality, and good practicability. But please note that the object is basically animal tentacles Insect goblins and orcs, etc., please decide by yourself to purchase. ""Trail Explorer"" is said to be composed of five story groups: waiting for Marianne and Marie, and the tragic righteous thief Liba that he thought of until his death Ston, the saint Sherazet who was killed by the fruit, the Cuim and Witte who supported each other, and Cupid and Avar who carried them on their backs. Their stories are all righteous, and they are all alone. Live for yourself. At this level of justice, it is already a piece of butter. It is also the adventure story of Kuim and Witte, which is woven by everyone to the one they love. All of them desperately, Work hard to find the righteousness of your own existence. Struggle to love others, to be loved by others. To eliminate yourself and hope that the other person can reach the place she expects. If asked, I will push this butter, I will consider it For a moment, because if it is pure, the test tour price will be more preferable. If asked, I will push this RPG, I push it, because it is already in my eyes. ",True,False

I liked the plot, I didn't start with anything, and then, as it was, it was always clear, but I came to read about the original Nier, because Nier: Automata is one of the endings of Nier (game of 2010). The gameplay is monotonous (probably because lesher, not a fan of leshers, orne). There are vkie side effects, some of them are very cool and reveal southern details. As the game progresses, the gameplay changes a little (when you fly on a ship or ...). An open and almost confused world because ... Music is gorgeous, but in some locations it comes. To understand the game, you must complete it three times, at least. Game mechanics are chips. To see the minimap, markers, hp, you need chips that you insert into eb (there is a special menu). The combat also demands them. It’s hard, of course, to tear, dodge, counter-attack, control the hearth (a robot that flies with you, such as an assistant), squeeze heals and cuddles during bo, when a crowd of enemies attacks you above your level (fortunately, auto-chips, then find) ... Tech chat. This is hard) Not only is the graphics soapy and the game is still running at 1600x900, while the fp is stable. One thing happened, when the game is in the window, it runs in normal 1920x1080, but the fp is lower than with the soapy rattling 1600x900. Still you can not make the game in a window without a frame (only using a program or mod). Yes, you can also show about fashion, set it up to the norm, on the ice day the game will not boggle, but the prototype is in processes, in short, by the removal method, etc. ... Dialogues, they are not voiced, it seems that the atmosphere is taka, for me it is not very much. In the course of the game, the developers develop a fetish-changing camera for you. Either side or top, etc. :) The main characters are very beautiful and have voi secrets, against the background of the game world they are something like a cherry on a cake without an ahara. Liked the animation of the chatits or something like that, even if you ate the sword, it will return for a pin, if you change the weapon, too. Perhaps 2b has some kind of portals on the pin, that is not ponl, heee. In general, the game stifled positive emotions and a brain explosion from the south.

1528,"THE DEFINITIVE REVIEW Phasmophobia is a horror game where you are placed into the shoes of one of four ghost hunters, sent to a house/building to complete four objectives. The main objective is to find out what the ghost is with pieces of evidence. Once you gather three pieces of evidence, you should be able to figure out what the ghost is. Sometimes, the ghost can show up and lock you in your current area. This is where the scary part happens, because the ghost will enter ""hunting mode"" where it comes to the physical form, to hunt you down and kill you. If you have a camera during this event, you can snap a photo of the ghost. There's different models of ghosts (the scariest one is the ghost which crawls on all fours). The game's super immersive even outside of VR, and aside from the funny models and animations the ghost hunters have, you will get super immersed and scared once the power cuts. This game has a ton of potential, the developer should 100% hire more people to work on the game, to make it out of early access. The reason for this is because a ton of bugs still plague the game, mostly connection-related. Bugs happen where you can't hear  your friends, or they can't hear you. Other times during the loading phase, it either kicks you out of the lobby or straight up crashes you. This game doesn't really deserve an ""overwhelmingly positive response"" but rather very positive. If these bugs were fixed, and more variety of maps and ghosts were added, and overall more polishing then this game could be my favourite horror game of all time. I give Phasmophobia a 8/10 for being a super unique, interesting and immersive game. ",True,True

The Alien species, The Klaath, have managed to enter the station and the only hope to save it is to turn on the Delta protocol, which at one stage was a number of fighting robots. But only one robot managed to get back online, and it’s you! Get ready for the fight in Outpost Delta! Outpost Delta is a side scrolling platformer game developed and self-published by Hidden Achievement LLC on 20th of October 2020 on the Steam platform. The game is also available on PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. After a short introduction and tutorial, you’ll be right in the thick of it!  Here you are with a gun and the ability to jump and duck.  The station is some sort of a labyrinth with plenty of doors to open as long as you have the right keys. It seems that you need at least six keys per level to open all the doors. However, you can move on to the next level if you want to, and most importantly if you can. I say this because I’m presently stuck in one of the parts of the station. I managed to get all power cores online, but I just can’t figure out the next step. I’ll expand on this a little later.  Joule will outlay your objectives as you go along. As mentioned, each part of the station is like a labyrinth of doors where you have to find keys to open them. You’ll immediately be fighting slimy dark things that crawl on the floor spitting projectiles at you, as well as robots that look remarkably like you.  You’ll also have to fight electro flying discs, the worst nightmare for a robot, if you want my opinion; nobody, including robots, wants to have their circuits fried! The other obstacles I have found so far are the green lasers, and boy don’t touch them; if you do, your life will go downhill quickly!   Nonetheless, you’ll have to deal with all the enemies and obstacles within the station. Luckily, there are several save points; in some of the rooms you’ll find glass cylinders, and by jumping inside them, you’ll save your progress. Early on in the game, you’ll discover these cluster things or debris which stop you from going to adjoining rooms. You can’t do a thing about it until you find a tool that can disintegrate them and give you access to another room within the level. However, as you’ve had to activate and deactivate power cores, lifts will not be working, which may cause havoc. Thankfully you’ll find magnetic boots which will get you from one place to the next on the level.  You’ll know when you’ll be able to use these boots as the walls, floors and ceilings will have light blue tiles with spots which indicate the magnetic fields.   After 3 hours of gameplay, I’m stuck! One of the problems is that I can’t get back to the main objective. There are no reminders or way to show you what your objective is. On top of that, Station map icons are minimal, which is a bit of a bugger. Don’t get me wrong, I like the game! It’s an old-school style of game, but even so, you need to help the gamer somehow, and personally, I can’t get any further. I have the feeling it’s something to do with the power cores, but I can’t figure it out and the hints are slim! We need to have access to a more detailed map, or at least be reminded of where we have to go when we need to refresh our memory; it’s a shame that this is not the case.  The pixel graphics are lovely, and while I understand that the developer wants to replicate the style of old-school games, we do still need to access our goals at any given time, and a better map feels essential. Positives: ~~~~~~~  +	Lovely pixel graphics +	Old school gameplay +	Achievements Negatives: ~~~~~~~~  -	No trading cards as yet -	Need maps with more details -	No objective reminders 6/10  Outpost Delta is under attack! Can you beat the Klaath out of the station? Key provided by the developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own! ",True,False
1548,"There are 6 kingdoms and khanates in the game -Veigar Kingdom -Kergit Khanate -Rodok Kingdom -Svadia Kingdom -Saranid Kingdom -Nord Kingdom Each kingdom has a king and different lords. You can recruit soldiers from the villages of these kingdoms, they join you voluntarily, level up and reach the highest levels. You can keep yourself on good terms with these kingdoms, or you can plunder villages and cut off the caravan's path and ruin it! In the game, there is a rating system that determines the sincerity between each kingdom and lords. For example, if you pillage a village of the khergit khanate, your relationship with the khergit khanate will decrease by minus 1, but there is a situation like this! The kings take some villages for themselves and distribute some to their lords. This means that you have disadvantages with both the khergit khanate and the owner of that village. Kingdoms sometimes have feasts in their cities and you can participate in tournaments to qualify for banquets. You bet on yourself in tournaments and if you win you can get back 2 or 3 times more, and the more you win, your reputation increases! There is an extra reputation in the game, you can earn a reputation in battles, tournaments, and missions. Now let's come to the war part: If you see a small army from your army while you are traveling on the map during the game, you can attack it directly. Moreover, you do not have to specify the reason for the attack. In the war you win, you can take prisoners and sell them to slave traders. You can sell your captured lords to slave traders. But if you do not sell and wait, they will send you an offer to take back that lord from the kingdom of which the lord is Lord. If you release the lord without charge, you will earn an excellent amount of Honor. Moreover, you can become overlords of kings and hire their armies from the lords and seek support from them. I would like to give you a little clue and end the matter. Things you need to pay attention to while gathering your army: THE KINGDOM OF RODOK: The most necessary thing when capturing the castle is the archers and the archers of Rodok are the best archers in the game. They work great with a good tactic! THE KINGDOM of the Nord: As you know, there are certain groups in wars; Archers, Infantry, Cavalry etc. The Nord kingdom has the best infantry in the game. Kingdom of Swadia: The best armored and durable cavalry is in this kingdom. Officially, they are in a complete TANK position as MOBA style games call it. Sarannid Kingdom: It is the fastest and confirms the concept of ""EZ LATE"". They are very useful in wars. Kergit Khanate: Its pike is famous. For example, if you put them in the front row, they can paralyze the horsemen coming from the opposite side. ",True,False

1550,"Well, let's just say this game is great. Aside from a few guys trying to hit on you, or saying pick up lines to you this game is pretty good. The TTT servers are all different in their own ways, but the differences can be good or bad depending on what you like. For example a server I am a Mod on has tazers, light sabers, and a poisened AWP as some weapons, while another server I am mod on only has the basic weapons for Traitors and Detectives. The bad things can include RDMers who just murder innocent people when they are innocent, or people who are just plain racist and mean but the good weighs out the bad. Now, the prop hunt servers on Garry's Mod are amazing. Basically you hide and people find you, but usually you get those really funny people that just brighten up the day. Let's not forget about Murder. That game has the same functions as TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) except there are bystanders, bystanders with guns, and a murderer. Those two games (TTT and Murder) can make you develop trust issues but trust me they are fun. Bottom line of this is: If you want guys hitting on you get this game! Or if you want to play with some funny people get this game! OR if you just want to say pick up line to chicks GET THIS GAME!! ",True,False

1574,"In general, this game is very good, since you immerse yourself (haha because it is a submarine) in the perspective of a commander in chief, in the year 1940 approx. Where you have to be on the lookout and manage in the best way the different things you have, such as the amount of gasoline that is used, the battery, the food, the oxygen (while you are submerged), the ammunition and even the spirit of the crew! But the most complicated part of the game is not to shoot down planes, sink enemy ships or submarines, or calculate their distance, speed or position, the most difficult thing is to TRY TO DOCK THE SUBMARINE IN THE PORT WITHOUT CRASHING ANY PART OF THIS. It was, without a doubt, what cost the most, which led me to have to save the game and if it crashed, load it again until I tried to dock it. The bad points that I found were the gameplay and the interface, which is a bit complicated to understand and also not intuitive at all. Another thing was the optimization, there were moments in which the game was marked (just in the moments in which you received damage from the enemies) and you had to close it and reopen it, which in the long run became tedious and frustrating. As for me, I recommend this game 100%, but if you can buy it when there are sales, it would be ideal. ",True,True

1578,"A basic game to connect the dots, very good to pass the time. Despite having 100 levels, they increase the difficulty when passing each one, which is a positive point since you end up getting used to the style of the game after about 20 consecutive levels. But despite that, each puzzle has more than one way to solve it, so you can go back and play the past phases at will and try other ways of solving. The OST is very soft and combines well with the relaxing proposal of the game. The visual style is very nice and a super cool detail is that you can change the color of the background and consequently the dots, which I, particularly, found great since I have photophobia and the initial background (white) was bothering me a lot. I believe it is a very interesting tool also for those who have color blindness. Mega izi to platinize, and the achievements are alpha-numeric characters and random words (including some in Latin, if I'm not mistaken), so if you enjoy giving your steam profile a grade and using achievements to form words in the highlights, it it will be a hand on the wheel. (In this regard, it is good to remember that the achievements are very minimalist. If you want something more, try the ZUP series!) In general it resembles those little mobile games that almost everyone has on their cell phones to kill time in the bank line. If you like the genre, I highly recommend it. ",True,False

1580,"Nice concept, many flaws. CONS: - No graphic settings available, you can't set the screen resolution or play it fullscreen. You can maximize the window, but it'll keep the Windows menu bar in the bottom and the game's own window bar at the top. - It's buggy. The main character will freeze randomly or when it's killed. If it freezes randomly, it   come back to life if it takes damage from an enemy. If you were killed, you can't do anything else besides exiting the game (there's no way to go back to the main menu) - Now that we're talking about the main menu, I'm not sure if it qualifies to be a ""menu"". A proper, more clear menu with options, play, load, etc. would definitely be better - No co-op mode. At least having a local co-op mode would greatly improve the gameplay. It's funny (but difficult) to control both characters at the same time, and I guess that's part of the game concept. But having the two game modes (solo and co-op -option to play with someone else, each player controlling one of the characters) could be very funny. - No achievements, no trading cards. This game is begging for achievements, and with the cute artwork it would be very easy to create th trading cards and the required backgrounds/emoticons/badges.  - Did I say ir's difficult? PROS: - Cute graphics, nice story and game concept - Simple enough to play from the beginning but also has quite a few things to improve the gameplay (upgrades) - It's difficult, but because it is challenging, it achieves its goal to keep you playing Conclusion: Nice, casual game with a great potential, but still has a lot of room for improvement. It's worth the price when on sale ($0.99-$1.49) but at a $4 retail price I would expect it to be less buggy and that the developer will continue to add features to the game (proper settings, a real menu, local co-op mode, achievements, cards, etc.). EDIT: I just saw the Kickstarter campaign (I'd have definitely backed it at the $4 tier) and now I'm also missing the ""Digital book of game art, character designs, and personal secrets"" and the ""Digital soundtrack of game music"" as DLC. 6/10 ",True,False

1596,"This was almost as engrossing as Half-Life actually was. Of course, you can't beat God (Half-Life, in this case) if you're an angel (OF), God is God for a reason! And that's the stupidest analogy I've ever made up, but bear with me, games like Opposing Force are never easy to make justice in words. But what I mean is, even though this game can't beat Half-Life, it was incredible. I'm not going to lie; I found certain things a tiny, tiny tiny tiny bit more ""WOOOAAHHH"" than Half-Life, but y'know... HALF-LIFE, MAN. Something that amazed me from the game is the fact I was actually busting my ass to save every grunt I encountered. I loathed these bastards in Half-Life and Blue Shift; I mean, they killed the poor scientists/security guards and actually enjoyed it! It was so sad! And I'm so used to killing them that every time I encountered a group of HECU marines, I'd panic and start shooting them. Then I'd be like ""Oh. Right"", and pressed the F9 key (my reload last save). At first I didn't mind and let them die, but dammit, they grew on me, to the point I'd truly be attempting to save them. I just felt fond of them. Except for the grunt that pushes the scientist when he's asking for Freeman when you're about to board the Osprey in which you're supposed to escape. That grunt I killed. ALSO, TWO GRUNTS ABANDONED ME IN CHAPTER 11 (The Package). I WENT TO EXPLORE A ROOM AND WHEN I GOT OUT THEY JUST DISAPPEARED. . Getting more serious now, something that really impressed me from Opposing Force besides the guns, the Race X and the new ""puzzles"", was the large-scale battles you can have at times. If you take care of your squad, you can have a group of at least four grunts with you. So when you encounter a lot of enemies, the fights are phenomenal! Sadly, this only happened once to me, I was barely able to get three grunts to follow me most of the time because some grunts were just too stubborn and stupid to follow me. This is the strongest flaw I encountered in the game; the grunts' AI is really stupid in the vast majority of the time. And they were also generally pretty useless in battle, and I'm not even counting the times I died because of friendly fire. However, there was one time in which I was able to have an epic Black Ops-Shock Troopers-HECU battle. Replayed it about four times just to repeat the breathtaking sequence. Unfortunately, it was hard to achieve and generally I spent too much time in the game trying to get everyone to follow me, which is simply precious game-time wasted. This is quite disappointing, in my opinion, since the rest of the game is of such extreme quality.  Being someone who's mostly played modern games, I have to say Opposing Force (as well as HL and BS) looks really good and its graphics are not bad at all for being a nearly twenty year old game. And even if the graphics were terrible (they're decent, in my opinion), the game would make up for it with its fantastic atmosphere, gameplay, battles, bosses, guns, ambiance and so forth. I also adored Gordon's direct and indirect appearances; his ""employee of the month"" photograph (was that his office?), his constant mention by the grunts and finally his Chapter 6 (""We Are Not Alone"") direct appearance: where you actually see him. I seriously replayed that sequence seven times. I LOVE WHEN GAMES CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER SO DIRECTLY. Thinking that while you're still fighting your way through Black Mesa, Gordon is beating the crap out of Gonarch and everyone (or everything?) else. Opposing Force is, quite simply, a passionate application of creative design. I seriously cannot wait for Tripmine Studios' remake.  Definitely recommend the game. But as I also said on my BS review; only play it if you have played Half-Life. Otherwise, the game might feel dull to you and you won't understand the storyline, and won't be able to fan-girl over Gordon's appearances/mentions... well... if you're a crazy fan. Like me.

1601,"Battletech; Mechwarrior and Mech Commander series will be loved by everyone who follows and loves it. However, due to its mechanics, it may not satisfy some of the players who have not touched this series before. I can say that the game offers more than a simple turn-based strategy. With its added RPG elements, interesting story and slow-moving structure, it can engage the player for a long time. It is necessary to play Battletech, which has a very rich content, with a calm mind. Because keeping our mercenary team alive depends entirely on it. Many factors such as economic factors, strategy elements, MECH and pilot development, task selection, the right equipment for MECH can affect the course of our game. In particular, we may need to think carefully about the economy most of the time. Because money is not easy to earn. More precisely, you can lose what you have, let alone earning money, because of a wrong task or a mistake you made in the task. It is imperative to think very well and apply a correct strategy while fighting the enemy. We need to be able to use the advantages of the region we are in, look at the enemy from the right angle, identify the enemy's weak points, use the right weapons, use the right pilot abilities, and carefully observe the heat, geographic situation and robustness factors that affect our MECH before firing. During our missions, we are traveling in a small ship capable of carrying 4 MECHs. In the later parts of the game, we have a more MECH capacity and a download ship that we can develop according to our needs. According to the features we have developed, our ship can travel faster, our MECHs can be repaired faster and the morale of our mercenaries can be kept at a higher level. It tells about an early period in terms of the theme of the game. So outer space CLAN groups are not yet available in the game. Naturally, CLAN technology weapons and MECHs that we see in the Mechwarrior series are not available in the game. For example, my favorite MECH is Mad-Cat :( As a final word, Battletech is a rare production that pays off. If you are a fan of Mechwarrior and Mech Commander, it is a game you should definitely buy and play. Also, I have no doubt that the game will continue. Probably new missions and CLAN. technologies will be available as downloadable content in the future, and I suggest you also review the guide I prepared for Battletech. ",True,False

1664,"Since the remake of the first game in 2002, fans have relentlessly asked for the same to be done with its sequel, considered by many to be the best Resident Evil. And so, with a video message from producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, who announced the development in 2015, there was no other thought: Resident Evil 2 Remake is real. Disclosed of their intentions early on by CAPCOM, they intended to go beyond a remake and actually reimagine Claire and Leon's adventure through events in Raccoon City, using the new engine developed to not only beautify the old game, but also make it much deeper and thought-provoking without losing the essence of the classic. And honestly, they did. I believe that most are already familiar with the premise of the story, but it is good to present again as the game has become the best gateway to the franchise. Everything happens in the fictional Raccoon City in September 1998, where the Umbrella Corporation caused an outbreak of a virus known as the G-Virus in the city and turned the whole city into zombies. The player can choose between Leon S. Kennedy, a novice city police officer who arrives for his first day but is faced with the outbreak, or Claire Redfield, a college student who goes to the city after her brother, Chris Redfield , one of the protagonists of the first game and who has been missing since then. As in the original game, you can choose campaigns between characters through routes A and B - described here in the game as “Second Journey - and each one can be played with both characters, resulting in at least four zeroes. The campaigns share several scenarios and puzzles, but key moments for the progression of the story, the location of the items, weapons and codes to unlock the game's doors differ; it is even possible to access exclusive rooms for each character, revealing new routes and allowing to outline other strategies for getting around the scene. The biggest problem with the remake lies there, in the original game despite the same possibilities, the stories connected together and there was a canonical sequence to follow that was Claire A and Leon B, in this remake, CAPCOM left practically everything canon and in that the stories end up not hitting very well and there is a certain confusion of what really happened. But that doesn't take the shine off: Survival Horror came back with everything. RE2R brings all the elements that define survival horror in a modernized way, bringing back the camera on the shoulder of Resident Evil 4 coupled with the well-crafted environment of Resident Evil 7. The atmosphere was built to make the player tense at all times, even at times when he is already familiar with the scenario, as new enemies can appear and those apparently killed previously can come back to life, with scarce ammunition and inventory management to deal with them. In addition, it is no longer new to anyone, Mr. X takes on a role even more incorporated into the environment, being a stalker and that, although his mechanics are easy to understand, will add tones of tension and agony. In addition, it is notable how much effort they put into producing the game. Even though I played the classic a lot and at first I thought everything was going to sound familiar, the remake came and brought me a lot of new sensations and improvements that I sincerely consider a new game. The incredible visuals, which once again reveal the high quality of REengine, with highly detailed characters and enemies, frightening and unsettling scenarios with play of lights and shadows and impeccable sound quality demonstrate that the team was successful in this ambitious project. In addition to the traditional zeroes, the game enables the replay factor by rewarding for completing the stories in the shortest possible time through infinite weapons; there are also the classic “The Survivor Room” and “The Survivor Tofu” that return here. As a novelty, we have the “The Ghost Survivors“ mode, which brings some more playable characters in mini-campaigns. Go for me, you won't be leaving Raccoon City anytime soon. Resident Evil 2 is my favorite game in the franchise and has just been easily replaced by Remake. Capcom has managed to manage the balance between nostalgia and novelty very well, delivering a true survival horror that will make you tense and at the same time impressed how they respected the original content. Despite the delay, the wait was worth it and both longtime fans and potential newcomers to the Resident Evil franchise will be delighted with the best Survival Horror of recent times. ",True,False

1672,"Whenever I write a review, I like to give enough background to explain why it is worth playing or not playing. I usually dip into everything that is of significance, including gameplay, story, characterization, and anything unique about it. I make sure to avoid spoilers, but I also give a lot of body to my reviews. There hasn't been a game yet that I've merely said, ""Just play it,"" or, ""Don't even touch this, it's awful."" Moirai has broken that mold. I literally cannot explain what makes it so brilliant without ruining the experience. Most reviewers have said that, and I am taking that same stance. My recommendation is to stop reading this review and go play it. However, if you really want more justification to do so, I have listed some basic information that should not spoil anything. Many reviews don't touch on some of these details, so it feels worthwhile to share them. If it persuades even a single person to play Moirai when they otherwise might not have, it is worth it. For some background, I blindstreamed this game for three friends. All four of us were floored by it. Moirai certainly doesn't need my praise to bolster its success. Almost everyone who has played it has loved it. The main goal for me is to spread the word on its existence, and to get people who are on the fence to download it and try it themselves. This is your last chance to turn back and go in without knowing anything. If you want to know some basics on what it does effectively, continue reading. I was blown away by Moirai. Thank goodness I went in without knowing anything about it beyond its name and some images on the store page. There is a reason this is sitting at an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" rating. It completely deserves it. 10/10. It is nearly perfect in what it sets out to do. From a standpoint of looking at it for its intended goal, it succeeds, and it is a fantastic experience. That gives it this rare score, though for different reasons than most games I would give it to. ",True,False
1673,"I've been playing the Civilization series since the Amiga era. Civ 5 was probably the best game of the series, although it took two expansion packs and tweaks over a few years to get to over 4. Civilization 6 is exactly at this stage, I think. The district system, which is one of the new systems, suits well. As in all previous games of the series, every building you build has to be in an area within your borders, not in the city. This area can receive bonuses associated with the building you build. For example, if you are building a building that increases your science, it will provide +2 science to build it on a mountainside rather than on a flat land. Similarly, with the Civ 5, some world wonders could want a mountain or a desert around. The new district system will also ask you for some things in the wonders of the world (for example, Oxford University has to be somewhere around the campus building in the area you have, if it is empty, you have to demolish what it is) There are many similar innovations but the main issue I am focusing on is the passage of time. and the balancing of the game with the regulations (There are of course some shortcomings besides the fixes that the patches will make, one of them is the world map :(, I'm sure it was put in time one way or another but I couldn't understand why it was not added to the exit). For example, in a city, both jet fighter and There was also a jet bomber, but I definitely could not reach the second one, he did not let me choose. When the units were in the hangar, it was not a problem, but although they could stand in the city, they were ridiculous about choosing. If I sent it, the city's defense and its HP were 0. Orsam Civ 1 even had SDI as Defender. I do not understand what they are waiting for, for such a simple thing (there is a nice configuration about nuclear and that is about the district system, it used to be no big problem in printing the atom and taking the city, now after throwing the atom, the nuclear waste cleaning and structuring situation in the district There is, in the past, this was a destruction resolved in a much shorter time). There are this and similar incomplete and errors, if you buy the game, you will see that they are fixed one by one. It will take 1-2 years to fit exactly as I have seen from Civ 5. A small edit: The update, which comes under the name of Autumn, has brought several corrections along with minor cosmetic improvements. So, as I thought, the game will be improved gradually, innovations will be brought with expansion packs, and within 1-2 years, Civ 6 will reach the top of the planned concept. Just like in Civ 5. If you say 5 or 6 right now, 5 still has the expense, but 6 is definitely not a disappointment ... After about 40 hours, especially after seeing the importance of the spread of religion in the game, I started thinking that I can delete Civ 5 from hdd. I can say it left Civ 5 behind with its expansion pack ",True,False

Without the addition of ANSWER GUTY, you will not spend so long in the game. I spent about 50-60 hours in the game without DLS. Then he hastily abandoned it. Therefore, it is advised to take the game with the Forsaken, so that your immersion in the game was much longer. What did I get from this: 1. Awesome dynamic gameplay, which is diluted with huge hours of running around the map and farming ooze. 2. Beautiful drawn maps and planets with huge and LATER locations. 3. Nice graphonium, which is important for many games. 4. Protota and pontnot. And here we will write more specifically: I am a player from a similar genre, but I came from Warframe.

Either put on and there will be a top ult, then put on in order for the peak to be more, etc. Ve was well studied and CHOICE OSHEO to muorka, because I did not want the Second Warframe, only about the howl ordered. Now, for beginners, they made a break in the form of the initial 750 sludge. also 2 small additions, Warmind or something else. This gives the first 70 ~ 80 hours of gameplay to new players. Yes! This noticeably encourages new players to join the game. Halva + reach milestones. Although in our time it was necessary to farm the Crucible hard in order to raise howling gear for 1 ~ 2 oozes. Although adding Warmind and something else there, the Force rose to 350 and that was a new breath of air. Now it is much easier. If you want, you can once fuck a deadly raid or raid, which is a pretty good hello. I definitely advise you to download Deteny. And he will convince you that the game is good and addictive. Now what does the Forsaken have to do: 1. A new additional southwest, which added 1 day to my in-game gain. 2. Unexpected beginning and POT YASYUSHA KOTSOVK. 3. Assignment for EXOTIC EVOLVE ONE OF THE MAIN GE OEV. - CADE-6. 4. The chuvyrle who killed Cade. : / 5. Opening 2 huge locations and adding 3 raids. also the Acorn Throne and the Well.

1704,"Stories is a very appealing game at first sight. Similar to the Hand of Fate, it is a choose your own adventure game based on what choice you make. With its vivid colors, hand-drawn graph style and enjoyable world design Stories is a game that makes you sit back and chill for a minute. Its clever narrative design filled with sarcasm and stirring storytelling puts the game on another level and make you want to play more. Even though one playthrough varies between estimated 40 min to 1 hour, there are 24 different endings and 4 truths to unlock. With each truth you unlock, you get closer to the True Ending which is something I will address later. So, there is a thing. The game relies on choices that are for sure. There are enough different maps and choice varieties. You will eventually need to play some maps&choices over again if you want to go %100 and get all the 24 endings. However, although playthroughs are short and joyful they are not as deep as Hand of Fate (or similar games in this genre). Also, the gameplay is quite easy when you get used to it. There are sadly not enough different types of enemies -only some different versions of the same enemies- another drawback is there are some skills but they are usually passive and leveling up could be grindy. Still, it's a good thing to have skills and a wide skill tree. There are also different weapons with different abilities which you can upgrade. I don't find them very effective that's just another point. With some cool animations and stuff, Stories looks good to the eye but can't get over an avg hack&slash.  Also, as it is something I said before, there is a True Ending. Idk if I got lucky but I managed to get all 4 truth in 5 playthroughs and it was around 4.4 hours for me. So the game's length is approx. 4 to 6 hours if you want to see the real ending. I personally liked it as our protagonist learns from his previous mistakes and adventures, combine all the results together and change his fate. Also, the other characters in the game were pretty likable. At the end of the day, Stories: The Path of Destinies, as it is advertised, is a colorful, acrobatic and most definitely a sarcastic game. Easy to catch, would be joyful for a few hours. Narrator and story could not be everyone's cup of tea, so take notice. 7.5/10 ",True,False

Gameplay is very good, combining a ton of weapons, abilities, and moves.  It takes a while to get used to switching between all of them to fit different monsters and environment interactions.  Finding items and collectibles is also fun, although to gain 100% completion you need to go back and replay levels because you won't have every ability needed the first time you tackle most levels.  I'm not into playing games twice (Skyrim and Mass Effect are sole exceptions), but if you do, this game has replayability value.  Finished in 13 hours and gets an A in my book. ",True,False
1723,"One of the best puzzle games I've played.  It really does a great job of gradually making more complicated puzzles while simultaneously training you how to solve them.  Strikes a PERFECT balance of difficulty and accessibility.  Out of what seemed like hundreds of puzzles I only had to google the solutions to 2 of them, and even then it was just because I got impatient, the solution was there the whole time.  Many of the puzzles were just hard enough to really require some time and thought but then really made you feel genius when you solved them.  If you liked Portal and Portal 2 you'll love this.  I didn't really care for the philosophical and theological aspects.  If you have a fully formed worldview already then the philosophical/theological themes won't do much for you.  If you haven't taken the time to think much about philosophy or theology I suppose it could be pretty interesting and thought provoking. ",True,False

1756,"Oh dear. Under appreciated gem, even by me for a long time. It can have a terrible first impression, but it really grows. Certainly a BRUTE, when it comes to software polishing. This is a game that I've hustled the most to get it going nicely in performance. But........damn! The physics are spot on for what you can feel on real life GT3 races onboard broadcast and the sounds are magnificent in comparison to the digital overload of Assetto Corsa. People say it is the best GT3 sim on the market, you can see that brilliance in the game here and there. All tracks seems to be laser scanned. Which is glorious. Maybe even the cars are laser scanned. The level of detail is in line with Assetto Corsa. The UE4 engine is where the weaknesses starts to appear in this. Make sure you have some graphics not on the lowest or the game will look really bad... but in other hand, this is the most graphically advanced racing sim out there. What has marketed Project Cars games, ACC does better, but no photomode afaik. :c (F7 key does wonders though. Use middle mouse to show camera controls :)) This is not for the impatient and if you plan to play with a pad, you need to have a long sit through and tweak it out the different steering values. If you're going with a wheel, you will find an ocean of wheel support and pedals and configurations as the sim was made for. This is not for the IMPATIENT (AGAIN!!!)... because you need to learn (if you haven't already with AC) to drive safely and respecting your competitors! It is an endurance focused simulation and not a 3 lap stint blazing all four wheels and drifting every corner. Learn to drive. Smooth it out your aggression. Have a wonderful race with other people who also loves motorsports. A better GT3 racer than Assetto Corsa would ever be. I miss all those contents, though.

(Weak but can hit multiple enemies at once), rapid fire shot (my favorite. Doesn't have a scatter effect but does take down enemies quick), a wave (can hit multiple enemies at once but kinda weak.) a rocket (much better if you have the sidearms too. They scatter and it can be tough to hit enemies), and a laser. (Also passes through enemies. Pretty strong, but rare.) You can pick up two sidearms to triple your firing power of whatever weapon you have active, and there's a 2x score multiplier. You get additional ships fairly easily in game, but it's one hit and you're destroyed. This is not a bullethell shooter, and even if you've played games like tyrian 2000, you'll probably find this one on the fairly easy side.  Pros: 1: Very cool artstyle. 2: I like some of the effects. Level 1 has a long train boss for you to destroy. Level 3 has a volcano that rains rocks and coins. Level 4 is a polluted city. 3: The music. I can identify the level 1 music as a commodore 64 remix of Comic Bakery with a splash of Jurassic Park NES level 1 music. 4: Picking up same colored powerup icons extends the time you can use the weapon. Cons: 1: When you die if you have anything special like the sidearms, you lose them. This can make things like the bosses challenging when you're given sidearms and rockets to shoot the boss with. 2: No real upgrade system to speak of, or even a in game shop of any kind. Once the time runs out, you lose your special weapon It's worth picking up if it's on sale. ",True,False

1795,"Hitman: Absolution is a stealth video game developed by IO Interactive and published by Square Enix. It is the fifth installment in the Hitman series, and runs on IO Interactive '​s proprietary Glacier 2 game engine. Before release, the developers stated that Absolution would be easier to play and more accessible, while still retaining hardcore aspects of the franchise. The game was released on 20 November 2012 (which is in the 47th week of the year in reference to the protagonist, Agent 47) for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Hitman: Absolution was met with a polarized reception. Most positive comments were concerning the game's graphics, environments and locations, and the varied gameplay options. However, many critics disliked the game for not ""feeling"" like a Hitman game. As of March 2013, the game has sold over 3.6 million copies. The game is played from a third-person perspective and takes place primarily in the United States, mainly around the city of Chicago, Illinois, and the fictional town of Hope in South Dakota. The player controls Agent 47, a master hitman. Gameplay is very similar to past Hitman games; as such, it is a stealth game that incorporates action gunplay.Players choose how to complete each level, taking branching paths to get to a target or location.Players may use pistols, bottles or bricks, assault rifles, shotguns, fiber-wire, or steel pipes, against enemies if opting for the action oriented approach, or avoid enemies all together, not being seen, using disguises, blending in the environment, and only attacking the set target(s), if using the stealth oriented approach. In the aftermath of Hitman: Blood Money, Diana Burnwood, Agent 47's handler with the International Contract Agency, suddenly goes rogue, carrying out a catastrophic sabotage that includes publicly exposing the Agency. The Agency reforms under Agent Benjamin Travis; Travis assigns 47 to kill Diana and bring Victoria, a teenage girl in her care, to the Agency. Shooting and wounding Diana in her home in Chicago, 47, rather than executing her, comforts the dying Diana, who gives him a letter and asks him to keep Victoria safe from the Agency. ",True,False

1818,"FIFA 2005 was my second game for desktop computers right after my beloved racing game: Need for Speed: Undeground 2. It was a time where I could only dream about the Internet. That's why I devoted my time to my career. I was really hooked on it, so much so that I was able to play a dozen or so seasons with the same team (unforgettable free kicks). The following parts also gave me a lot of fun, and when we got the opportunity to play the FIFA World Cup 2006, I just felt such a simple and incredibly relaxing joy in my heart. There was also a supplement to FIFA 2012 where we could play the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament. Unforgettable moments. I apologize for this long introduction. You are probably wondering why He writes about His memories? Let me explain ... Recently, I have been observing a lot of negative emotions that appear during many game premieres. It's really nothing but ordinary trolling and there is nothing to worry about :) I am a long-time fan of FIFA and I am well aware that the next parts are a jump on the money, but we also have to remember one important thing ... Nobody forces us to buy . We can wait for the promotion and then get to know what I have loved most about FIFA in recent years ... Alex Hunter's career and VOLTA mode. These two things bring Story Mode to FIFA. Yes, you didn't hear it. VOLTA did not appear until FIFA 20. However, Hunter's adventures include 3 parts (FIFA 17, 18, 19). To my surprise, we have the ability to transfer game saves, which makes us really care more about this boy! In Fif 19 we will even direct the actions of a girl in the US team, who will not even expect how close she is to Alex! We will also meet his famous grandfather and the rest of the family. The story mode rocks, so I recommend that you buy some older parts. Unless… you are addicted to this game and the Ultimate Team mode. I warn you. This is where the stairs begin, but more on that in the next paragraph. Ultimate Team is fun with multiplayer ... FIFA 20 has significantly changed the face of this mode. Seasons have emerged. In which we perform daily, weekly, etc. tasks. If you want to build a good squad and play with the best as equal, you need to prepare for a systematic game;) Otherwise, you will have / will have a worse squad and your opponent will take you down on the shoulders only. I heartily recommend the game to all football fans. It is definitely worth reaching for the older parts and feeling the taste of the adventure together with Alex Hunter. Finally, I would like to add that the most important thing is for you to enjoy the game ... Krakow was not built in a day and you will not become professionals who will be able to deal with every rival without difficulty;) If you need any tips, I am here to help. Stay warm!

1823,"Spoiler free. So have it through now. More times will follow. it is an absolutely stand-alone game that can also be played without the main title. Of course, in many parts it refers to the ""successor"" as it were, but here only the story is told from Chloe's point of view. This is also where the dog is buried, the story of Chloe is told and you don't slip into the role of Rachel, as many fans had hoped. In the following I try to explain why BTS is still an extremely worthy prequel. I don't know what it is, but this part also successfully gave me back the feeling that the main part triggered in me. It is the extremely beautiful, suitable graphics, the setting, the characters and of course the LIS universe itself, which together evoke the will to be in this universe myself. As corny as it sounds, it is therefore very easy for me personally to put myself in the shoes of the protagonist and to follow her train of thought. It is then of course all the more difficult to make the important decisions á l ""your actions will have consequences"". Once selected, there is no going back, as in the main part. For this reason alone, the replay value of this masterpiece increases infinitely, among other things again because of the comparison of one's own action decisions with those of all other players, which appears in the old manner after each episode. Not a penny is wasted with this game. Unfortunately, BTS isn't as good at causing sweaty eyes as its ""successor"", but maybe it's better that way. The episodes here also seem a bit short to me, and unfortunately there are only three in number, which in turn makes you want more and thus benefits the replay value again. In retrospect, I didn't notice many details of the level design, and I even regret some of the decisions I made. Why should that be good? Correct! Replay value! All in all, I recommend this game to everyone. And the predecessor as well, if not already played. And to all of you who are dissatisfied with the ending: The final scene provides information about what happened to Rachel. In the end, Rachel stays as she is in the game itself, namely the inscrutable. Haters gonna hate, potatoes gonna potate. ",True,False

Boevka thala was less hurricane and more tactical, it was just a minute, but someone will come. Stel was introduced for a variety of gameplay. Feels like a foot, but I personally didn’t hit those moments in the game. Dracula himself is gorgeous.

An adventure of the loving mother who goes on a quest to save her daughter, filled with mystery, drama, puzzles and a whole cast of unique and memorable characters This game impressed me for real and got me into it's story. It's ADDICTIVE since each puzzle is original, challenging, and none of them frustrating, cause after minute or two you'll be solving em like pancakes! (And it adds a nice flavour when you're feeling yourself smart) Oh and if you're having any trouble with them there are hints available OR alternative puzzle to complete in order to progress (It's always nice to have options).

1956,"Hometown War's simple anti-war work 3.5/10 Push crowd: curious players who like anti-war questions Test duration: 0.5 hours Test level: Steam + rare anti-war questions + map design with contract background + Bot-fewer maps-poor Weapon feel-up-bouncing action-virtual machine sight-Bot are all English characters. This is a Chinese own FPS independent tour with the theme of the War of Resistance against Japan. There are multiplayer models in the tour, there are death match teams, death matches and point three How to play. The characteristic of the tour lies in the rare topic. In ""Blood Battle on the Beach"", I have hardly been to the domestic anti-Japanese shooting tour. Consistent with the topic, the map of the tour has obvious Shanghai style at that time, which is eye-catching. Since there are no players to play, the game comes with Bot for the players to entertain themselves. But the characters of the bots are simply derived from CS1.6. They are all English characters called JackWyatt. If they are translated into Chinese and Japanese, it will be very interesting. After all, the tour is made by a studio. There are many shortcomings. There are four maps in total. The texture of the weapons is often strange. The light effects of many weapons are very exaggerated, which makes people feel like they are fighting with a mirror. The sights in the game turned out to be the sights we imagined. It is hard to describe. The weapon does not move when it is bombed. It disappears when the weapon is bombed. The weapon appears after the bombing, and the craftsmanship is often used. This game has just been listed on Steam, priced at 40 yuan, I am too pushy, and I have tried it for those who like to fight against FPS. Seeing that it is a question I like, and it is easy to produce independently, I refunded it and gave it a good comment. ",True,False

1984,"During the Metal Gear Survive open beta, I had the opportunity to dive into this controversial game and play for a few hours. Metal Gear Survive caused a lot of uproar among many fans and there were only such negative comments when the announcement was made, as it has little to do with the actual Metal Gear Solid. But how does the beta play? Metal Gear Survive is not a successor to Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain. It's more of an offshoot that follows Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes, the prologue to Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain, and tells a parallel story to the disappearance of the soldiers from Mother Base. They have to fight for survival in a parallel world in front of zombie-like beings and collect resources. The gameplay differs relatively little from Metal Gear Solid 5. There are still stealth mechanics that you have to actively use, as the new opponents can deal well even on the simplest level of difficulty. The biggest difference in Metal Gear Survive is in the weapons. Unlike its predecessors, the focus is more on melee weapons such as spears or machetes. Firearms are available, but the resources required to produce ammunition are too high. In general, you have to collect a lot of resources in order to build, improve or repair weapons or other items. These are in boxes or on the floor. Within the beta there were two maps, a mode and three levels of difficulty, which you could play alone or with up to 3 other players together. The playable mode is comparable to a horde mode. It's about setting up a drill and defending it from three waves of attack. Between the waves of attack you have time to collect more resources to set up traps or fences. There are also a few small missions to gain advantages, such as a weapon box or a small robot that can be used in an attack. If you and the drill survived the three rounds, there are several boxes with other rare resources depending on the ranking. The player takes all the resources earned in the mission back to the base in order to tinker with them. Many will not play this game on principle because it is not by Hideo Kojima. At first I was of the same opinion. However, as a big fan of the Metal Gear series, I have to admit that I had a lot of fun in Survive and invested a lot of time in the beta. Even if you got to know the two cards quickly, the laps were always exciting. And to take up the question again. Is that still Metal Gear? Yes! Because Metal Gear Survive lives from the elements that make Metal Gear. The setting is a bit strange for many, but hasn't Metal Gear always been a bit strange? One should rather ask whether it is still a Metal Gear Solid. Because then the answer is clearly no! Metal Gear Survive is a completely new project that has been very interesting to watch since it was announced. If you hide the fact that the cover says “Metal Gear”, with Survive you have a very interesting stealth survival game with campaign and co-op as well as a great fun factor. If you're expecting a Metal Gear Solid, you'd better avoid Survive and wait for Death Stranding. But if you want to experience Metal Gear differently, you should take a look at the beta, which will run until February 18, 2018. The full game will be released on February 22, 2018 for € 39.99 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. ",True,False

Another detail is the price that doesn't make sense, 2 min of research c you get a snes emulator and the roms, the only reasons for you to choose to buy are u be honest and the online if you have any interested friend too.

The whole idea is good and it builds the tension up. The ending is good also. One of my min positivum were the characters. I loved them all, my favourite is Akira, and no one can say anything bad about her. All of them have a very well built background and they are very well written, even the side characters have logical emotions and growth in the story.  The only one I didn't felt that fleshed out was the end villian, but it really wasn't that big of a deal. The art is basic, but the CGs are really well done, overall its on the good end. Music fits the games tone very well gets you in the mood. My only problem was, that the English is not that good, it needs some rework, but still won't make the experience any worse. Also Its long 10+ hours so that is also a plus Overall, its a quality novel, for a really cheap price, 10/10 I loved it, every part of it. I will miss the characters, but if there is a chance that we could see Akira ikeda and Neneko in another novel I would be really happy and insta buy it. Really thank you for this novel!!

For example, you can escape by repairing boats or cars. You can call the police or seek help by radio. These are what I've experienced, and I don't know that much.

1997,"For those who are too lazy to read a sheet, I made for that wonderful game.At the same time, I was wildly fanatical about CF and was happy with the appearance of the second chat, but because of the howling philoophia that the game cannot cost more than 300 rubles, because it was tap, kept her in the desired for a long time, but damn. I would know for how much 2a a ** enna, would take for the usual price without hesitation. Now I know where the fucking summer is. Briefly I will try to share my impressions for those who, just as they played the first murderous floor, torment them in their thoughts, whether it is that. In addition to the 7 familiar clauses, there are 3 more new clauses. The shooter - they run exclusively with petics, they move from 2 hands at Macedonians, they move quickly, they look efficient, but not very effective, in general, they are not very effective, they are distinguished from the commandos by the fact that they run not with automatic weapons, but with PPShkami, which show some kind of optic sights and digital diplomas cartridges are gone, apparently the delivery of cartridges to the cartridge receptacle is carried out by rasping cartridges in iCloud and downloading via iTunes. The recoil is much lower than that of the machine guns in the commando arena, which is tenacious thanks to the heavy armor, which is why it appears more often in the game, and it will be more useful in fact. Survivor - always, and the Swiss, and the reaper, and the player on the pipe, gets experience for a trill from any weapon and has bonuses a little bit from the milestones of the clauses, at first I thought that something dull g * obviously was not good for anything, but with competent On three perks I saw that that imbued sh * t that spoils the balan, in my most inexperienced opinion. Because has both the vitality of the ber and healed the medic and the lethality of the demolition. The pumping is now not up to 6 levs, but up to 25, while it was easier, now you do not need to shoot 5 lm of damage and kill 5k talkers for pumping, but just play for the howl kla, now you will not see how the first go to the server the wave has lasted for half a hour and 2 technicians take turns to weld the door. In a couple of days, you can completely pump the kla to the end and go to pretending, then start pumping the beginning, the kla icon will change a little, now you are an ilite, take the shelves of a pie, I don’t know if they give anything for that, I didn’t try. Every 5 BGN gives 2 perks to choose from, you can change them at any time. The zeds are almost the same, only new species have been added to some types, for example, Klots are now of three types - Kit, alpha iiiii ... yes, as they were halva frags, so they were otal. Ber ordinary and ber-adovnik 2 blades, tenacious, faster, angrier, dances well, I like it. By the end of the waves, as usual, there is a flash pound, he is also a slugger and a mini-slug)))) his budgetary faith) apparently added it for those who dreamed of single-handedly filling that montrilla, but there were not enough ilens. They also added a robot, in general it conducts long-range combat, trills with missiles, a laser, maliciously violates the first law of robotics. He does not fit into the atmospheric atmosphere at all and, as he read, he was added recently, I hope they will come up with something in the future. At the end of the milestones of the waves on the bo, Vё is the same patriarch, He sang a rocking chair, became bald, tal more agile, drinks pi * dulina for not paying the kid to the temples as efficiently. To it added 3 more new boa Foul-mega pushing with huge axes and in armor, burps nasty, in addition eats their own clots and ret flobbers from the movie by Wilm. Gan Voltaire - UberSturmCyberpunkFuehrer wielding two MR 40 assault rifles, a silt field and combat techniques of a gas chamber. The Slugger King - here, gopoda developers, have a fantasy like a ponl. oh well, it’s more suitable, but it’s the opposite of mini-slugs, who are very active in helping him and here they can pose a real threat, tk. a lot of them. The community is different, all the same shit, picking up a field of death after you and selling it to her for profit, greedily killing klots, giving you krkov and flash pounds, and team players who ram you party and give you tugriks (yes, Dosh calls tugriks) there is not enough spruce. the latter are met more often. I will be brief about the grafon: at minimum salaries - running in thin Lithuania, you can cut out a false form of appendicitis. on makimalkas - you can see the little pieces of cheap shawarma from the supermarket in the vomit of pusher to the smallest detail. In general, the grapher will be happy. The music is stubborn-perfect, prm from the initial theme in the menu, which is also chic, about all the mobs snarling at you, prm chic. to the end, even a cover on a theme from the first chat of the KF. Little minuik - Loot boxes have been added, loot boxes are always evil. oh, in general, that same old good favorite horror shooter with a bunch of ma and blood, atmospheric card design and hungry zeds to bake your escaping zedy with a cookie.

Unlike the first chat, it had almost everything that was missing, and mostly there were little things (for example, a redesigned waiting room). It is free of charge, requires a deep connection to the network and yes, there is a lot of donation in it (you can see it at the first glance at the additions), but the game does not get a penny out of the player. IMHO, an absolute ""must have"" for those who do not mind spending a couple of gigabytes of memory on a tough wild and have nowhere to put in their free time, but want to throw the martyr in the basket, do not spend a lot of silt on training. There are so many pluses in the game that it is easier to play (the game is free) to find out about them. Of the mines, I think, you can mark the menu in which you can get lost (if you don't find the ""back"" button, for example), and long downloads.

The plot line (more precisely, its duration) if it was longer by another couple of chapters, and it could be taken away to the minutes, and so in moderation. Fighting, I liked the quiet casual underscores at the moment of the enemy's attack, here you have to watch who is attacking and how. From mines: Bugs (ooo they are a bunch of proto). Optimization, what kind of crooked it is, deep friezes (especially beats at the moment of finishing off the enemy), problems of fp. As a result, it is not so clear - 50/50. If you like the Roman theme, the bloody battles take away the oldies, then definitely take it.

The game complies, if you are not a fan you can ignore the game since it does not contribute anything to the line of events of the North American Assassin's Creed saga. I felt a bit strange when I started the game, but little by little I got used to it and in the end, thanks to a twist in the story, the game caught me and I had to play it non-stop until the end.

2046,"So, a few months back I decided to play the   series. I wanted to go retro and revisit a dungeon crawler type of game I grew up on (late 80s early 90s) and through a bundle deal I grabbed both games.   Legend of Grimrock (LOG) is a first-person action role-playing game with realtime game mechanics. The Player manages a party of up to 4 NPCs which they move through a grid-based dungeon. LOG draws heavy inspiration from games like WIzardry, Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss, and Eye of the Beholder to just name a few. This game was published by ""Almost Human"" and released for Microsoft Windows in April 2012. You are a prisoner and the games starts out where you and three- (3) other prisoners are dropped off on top of Mount Grimrock. The group is being escorted by Knights! All of you have been sentenced by ""a court"" for crimes against the King, and have been sentenced to be thrown into the pit of Mount Grimrock. Whoever escapes will have their crimes absolved.  However, no prisoner pardoned in this manner has ever returned [DUN DUN DUNNNNNN] . Once being sealed within the mountain, the party of prisoners make their way through levels of Grimrock Dungeon. There is a guide.. A disembodied voice which comes to them in their sleep promising that a way of escape!  Find notes,  clues to puzzles and hidden stashes of equipment!   Learn the story behind Mount Grimrock! The story of the ""Undying One"" ... That is all I will say on the matter... Play the game! Gameplay consists of using a Keyboard/Mouse to navigate through the Dungeon, solving a combination of puzzles and combat. Characters within the party gain experience for slaying creatures and beasts within, allowing them to increase in level and progress skills which enhance combat abilities and allow the casting of new spells, and equipment is obtained through exploration and solving of puzzles throughout the dungeon.  I had a blast with this game. It met my expectations of an Action Role-Playing, Dungeon Crawler set in an atmosphere of constant dread and mortal danger. I will definitely play LOG 2. - Graphics are OK.. Respective to the year of release... Could use retexuring and re-releasing! - Great atmosphere and story, IMO, - Awesome soundtrack, - Boss fights were not so challenging (for me) one you learn the ""fighting dance"", Google it! - Highly repayable if you have the time.  - Via the Dungeon Editor - Plenty of Dungeon & Quest MODs attached to the steam workshop! - For me 75 hrs to complete base game + Item Collections + Achievement Hunting, - 1st Playthrough achievement progress: 36 of 40 (90%) - Normally $15... I'd wait for a sale....  - Great game! ",True,False

2069,"I just started playing this game two days ago.. I will say it defiantly needs some work, with combat and a tone of bugs. Though with combat, if you take you're time with it, it actually works.. For example, blocking.. After striking an enemy (Only twice) prepare for a block and wait a second or two after the block (They will attack within that time) then proceed with the attack asap.  Also there's bugs everywhere, but most are avoidable (Thank goodness) for example jumping over some fences tend to f#$k you up.. So, just take your time running around them.  But what i love about the game is well, it's medieval and it does it really really well in most cases.. I love the normal MMORPG style, going quest to quest, doing side-quest and doing anywhere, fighting anyone, anytime.. (Though it's odd fighting one guy and another just watches until you hit them (That's the mmorpg thing, remember!)   Another few things i love, but yet to attend (Because i'm only low level as of now) is the faction bases PvP, PvP area, The big amount of gear/loot, farming and so forth.  Also i suggest the developers add horses to the game because it's a huge open world and sometimes feels tedious just running to places far away.

I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games.  I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that! Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps. One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there.  Just give it a shot and see what you think!

2167,"aaah Firewatch! I bought it initially without really knowing much about the game, just a few screenshots here and there and ""This game is awesome""! I didn't think I had a real crush on this game! First a quick summary of the basic plot, without telling you too much: We play Henry, a guy who has a rather ordinary life with his share of problems and who leaves for the summer in Wyoming to become a forest ranger. His only contact with humans will be with another forest ranger through a radio. ___________________ This game is exotic, soothing, we find ourselves immersed in the environment. The forest that surrounds us is simply sublime, and we take a real pleasure just walking on the paths that cross it! Graphically beautiful, very beautiful with my sense a bit of mystery, the soundtrack that accompanies it is itself finely produced and perfectly matches the game. As for the story (without spoil), it is excellent, very well constructed, the evolution of the relationship of our two protagonists is really interesting, we even come to get attached to Delilah without ever seeing her and it is in my opinion a big strong point for the game. Despite everything, the main plot left me on my hungry, too many pending questions, and maybe it's happening too quickly? Anyway I think it's a deliberate choice on the part of the developers, see if you like it or not. Another point that I found very amusing is the way our little disposable camera and the photos we are going to take are used. The concept is rather innovative and quite funny. (This is also a point that makes immersion in history easier). So a tip, take great photos, it's worth it! The mechanics are not at all complex, and this is where I think we can categorize it as Walking Simulator. We are simply hiking all the time, and if for some games it can quickly get boring here, the beauty of the scenery is distracting enough to forget the way to go! The only really questionable thing about this game is its price, which for the life of the game is a bit high. Being fond of games of this kind I just loved this one. It's definitely my favorite of the year! ",True,False

Today, we will introduce an XBOX handlebar (360 and ONE) pan-slip simulation tool. This is my first (and possibly the only) software that I bought at the original price of Steam. It has a free set of hot definitions (input on time), but it does not have a macro of tricks (press input, for example: Street Fighters series boxing command input). After downloading and installing, open the Steam interface. It is normal under Windows (test environment Win10). It uses memory resources, about 13mb. The original software does not indicate the cloud step, but if you open the Controller in the Windows taskbar when Steam is open Companion (hereinafter referred to as CC) (or open from the Steam play library), just to set the content of the cloud step, the time will also record the software use hours and display them in Steam (in fact, my use hours exceed the displayed 100+ hours , The computer is often turned on, from 2017.02.14 to more than 1000+ hours). The mode of CC under Windows is self-setting. In addition to simulating the scroll wheel, the buttons on the handle are also customizable, and even the execution table path or specific program is set to the button. In fact, if you program common Windows programs, use your hand It is possible to fully control Windows. It is very convenient to browse the Internet and control the audiovisual process. The virtual disk is basically introduced in English, and the input is easy to use. If it is really off the disk, the recognition rate of voice input should be increased. It is the future trend. The CC's play model is determined to be that the play or play is opened in full screen. If the play or play is opened in full screen mode, the control model of the handle will remain in Windows for modeling. Personal experience is that the play is opened with Alt+Tab to cut Go to the window table, click the CC icon in the toolbar to enter the settings to see the picture of the play, and set the play individually. If the play itself supports the handle, deleting all the original settings will interfere with the original settings of the play. You need to set the buttons separately. Usually, I use the XBOX button to set screenshots or movie recordings. If you use Nvidia display, it is often easy to use GeForce Experience to record or take screenshots, especially some movies support Steam Overlay screenshots. Note that XBOX is usually set to Big Picture Mode or community mode by Steam, and it will be set to a screenshot or video. The solution is to disable the above setting. According to the settings of the job search, the play is basically applied directly, if necessary, also change the settings according to your own habits. Basically, if you want to play HTPC, CCKODI, etc., you can use the handle as the controller when you open the media player. When playing EMU or DirectInput, CC can be set. If there is a need for handle input, CC is similar to me. Among the simulation software, the most practical and cost-effective software, super recommended ",True,False

2278,"Hello friends; 1.835.928 In the game; First of all, I want you to see this. The number of players who are actively playing in the game right now is only a number that has been looked at around 10:00 on weekdays. I highly recommend the game and I would like to say that you get back the money you give to the game within weeks. There is a system in the game as follows; Play the game, earn game money, save and sell the crates you spend on Monday and get back the money you gave to the game. !! Like most Battle Royal games, our PUBG game has the same understanding. Play the game, survive and shoot everyone !!. I would like to make a short explanation without forgetting the fact that our game has an Optimize problem. As you know, the game has made a name for itself around the world and has managed to gather a really large number of players. This success was well announced and liked by both broadcasters and players. When tournaments are also involved, a large number of people seem to be locked into the game. The gameplay of the game is like other games, we have already learned the Battle Royal part from the H1Z1 King of The Hell series. The game has 4 mode options; We play our game on 2 separate maps: individual, 2-person team, 3-person team, and 4-person team. As soon as you jump off the plane, you can land at the targeted location, immediately find a gun, kill the players and look on your way, or you can go down to the countryside and go to the area where the game will be closed like a silent wolf. It all depends on your gameplay. The game gives you 5 minutes after throwing you from the plane, which is really enough, but if the space is not on your side, you need to find a vehicle. Every time the area shrinks, the likelihood of a man will appear and the possibility of seeing someone using the tree in front of you as a shield increases, so you need to be alert. There are sudden FPS drops and Graphics Drops in the game, this must be due to the fact that the game is not optimized, but it is not that bad, because most Multi-Player games already have an optimization problem, but for PUBG, this problem seems to be overcome in a short time, because the team is really seems to aim to do something for the game and the player. Afterwards, I recommend that you play the game with someone to get used to and understand the gameplay because the game is really enjoyable when you play as a team and it will feel good to know that you have someone watching your back. As a result, let's evaluate the game as follows. Graphics: 8/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Is the money we give to the game worth it? : 10/10 ",True,False
2279,"After more than 30 hours of gaming, I am giving my first review on PBGU. PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds is the best Battle Royale there is currently. It's a simple Arma BR, so it is also recommended for absolute beginners in the genre. PBGU did everything better right from the start that H1Z1 didn't get on the chains after years. The players jump out of a plane with a parachute and can choose where they want to go down, so no fixed spawn points. The size of the map is ideal and the increase in the plasma wall is perfect for ending the game quickly. If you have died, if you played in a team, you can see your mates gambling. PBGU offers a wide variety of weapons and there is something for everyone. The cool thing about it, however, are the weapon mods and these are numerous. The spawn rate is perfect, you land and you are fully equipped within a short time. There are also a lot of cars, and you are sure to find one after a short time. The play fun = ""shooting"" is clearly in the foreground here. The graphics are great, but you can still play it flawlessly with rather poor PCs if you turn everything down. The performance has yet to be mastered! But absolutely sufficient for an early early access. PBGU is a game that is absolutely worth its 30 €! GREAT GAME! ",True,True

2290,"Battle for Bikini Bottom was a game that I saw videos and images of, but never actually played myself. When the remaster was announced, I was curious. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, and was somewhat surprised when I found myself really liking it. By the time I finished it, I could safely say that it was one of the best games I've played this year.  + The game retains the same wit and charm that the TV show is well known for, and is a brilliant video game representation of the world of SpongeBob. It's also good to see most of the original voice actors reprise their roles. Shame about no Clancy Brown though. + The levels all feel distinct from one another. Each location is iconic both in its visual design and its level structure. There was never a moment where I felt the levels were lacking. If anything, I'd say the levels are my favourite aspect of this game. + Although not that different from the original, the game is really satisfying to play. Most of the mechanics are smooth, and the combat is quite entertaining. + Each level introduces either a new mechanic or a new enemy. Because of this, the game always feels refreshing.   + The game is rather easy to play, but there are moments that can genuinely be challenging and force you to approach the situation from a different angle, something that I wasn't expecting and was pleased to see. + The updated visuals make the environments and the character models shine. The bright colours give everything more life, and as a whole, make the levels much more memorable. + Being able to play as Patrick and Sandy as well as SpongeBob varies up the gameplay a bit, removing the risk of repetitiveness. They're both also very fun to play as.  + The story itself is quite decent. Yes, it's childish, but it's exactly what you would expect from SpongeBob. It's an amusing, silly and memorable experience.  - A couple of mechanics such as Patrick's throw and SpongeBob’s Cruise Bubble feel a bit off. Patrick's throw is annoying to aim, and the Cruise Bubble can be awkward to control in enclosed environments. - Although a minor problem, sometimes the camera would feel a bit janky. It’s more noticeable when switching characters. Most of the time the camera is fine, but there is the odd instance where it got in the way. Battle for Bikini Bottom took me by surprise. I wasn’t expecting to have so much fun playing a SpongeBob game that was obviously aimed at kids, but regardless, I did. As somebody who used to watch this show as a child, it took me back. The same childish humour is there, and despite a couple of different voice actors, the characters stay true to their cartoon counterparts.  However, it’s the level design, the gorgeous visuals and the (mostly) smooth game mechanics that really make this game shine for me. The game never became repetitive and it never lost its charm. It found ways to keep itself feeling different and interesting. Yes a few of the controls and the mechanics feel a bit off, and that is a shame. I haven’t tried the multiplayer, and according to some reviews, it’s not great. Nevertheless, I don’t think these issues dumb the game down that much.  If you were a fan of the original Battle for Bikini Bottom, a fan of the show, or just want a fun platformer, then I highly recommend this. It’s one of the best games I have played this year. 9.5/10.

2297,"I've been following the work the guys from PopCannibal have been doing for one or two years; my first approach to this study was with Make Sail (I play with a premise totally different from that contained in KW). Kind Words is a ""game"" that has no benchmark in the market; Although it is sold as a game, I must anticipate that, beyond being a mere playful activity, it is a therapeutic activity; the fun is supplemented by the satisfaction of helping and being helped. Kind Words dares to explore a little or no exploited niche, which is why, as I have already mentioned, it becomes a singularity in the concert of video games. The premise of Kind Words will be broadly based on answering / writing letters. The nature of the content of the letters is not varied, it consists of a deeper and more reflective content; Inside all these letters are the problems of a mother, student, boyfriend, etc., so our purpose, as a recipient, will be to provide help. Likewise, otherwise, we can write our concerns from total anonymity. How does it work? It is quite simple and intuitive: The game has a mailbox -totally public-, which naturally deposits all the letters that people write. All you have to do is access that mailbox and choose which letter to reply to. It is important to add that both receiver and sender forge this whole process under anonymity (I recommend visiting the forums for more information regarding identity protection). Contact outside the letter format does not exist; the game's interaction -beyond the act of writing- is limited to giving out stickers when you are satisfied with the letter you have received in response to yours. The game will also have some incentives to participate: Stickers and decorations for our room. Somewhat minor, but there they are. It is missing a higher level of customization of the character and room. Technically speaking: The game is simple, but with a wonderful air of friendliness; we have a comfortable and intuitive interface, accompanied by a relaxing soundtrack (although a greater number of tracks would be excellent, because it tends to become repetitive), with graphics in accordance with the pretensions of the game, highlighting the fact of having a successful color palette. Nothing remarkable, but without bordering on the shabby. Anyway, I recommend this game to anyone who needs an escape valve.

It is one of those indies that, at least I, will remember from this 2019. ",True,False

2306,"For me, that was the first part of the Souls series that I was allowed to play. The game is good with the atmosphere, a huge number of weapons, a variety of booms (though some of them have no way at all.), A large number of spells and armor. The game is monotonous in metami, but the locations in the game are quite enough to please the eyes and penetrate the atmosphere of the passer-by. The graphics also do not drown the time. What the Southwest has: In the game there is a false and sometimes non-monetary, but very elaborate lore, exciting and previous games of ""dark souls"". Yes, in terms of hardcore style, the game dulls the previous games of this series (although I personally showed it 2 hours easier.), About DLC it can make you sweat. We made a better co-op item, unlike other games in this series.

I can tell you about the musical justification in bytes - it might be better, in my opinion, except maybe NieR: Automata. Bottom line: As the first game of this series, it causes me a huge amount of notalgia.

2327,"''The First Tree is a great game when you like walking-simulators. Like in other games of this genre the gameplay is not really to mention. You play as a vixen which is seeking after her cubs. Henceforth, you range over different types of landscapes - like forests, mountain and lake areas – while you are listing to Joseph, the main character of the game, who tells his girlfried/wife Rachel of his latest and most vivid dream of a female fox – so you reenact and witness his dream while you are playing the vixen.  So while you are moving forward in the game, you gain knowledge of Joseph's life, especially of his troublesome youth in the solitude of Alaska. The well-narrated plot is really the highlight of the game. Summarized, its very emotional plot is about personal life, loss, guilt and what's really matters in life. I really appreciate games which have a deeper massage and make one thoughtfully - even when one have finished them – about oneself, life or the world we live in. And this game really belongs to this sort of game. What else can I mention?  The art design and graphics are beautiful. It's like you playing a watercolour. Some sceneries are really breathtaking. The music you hear is marvellous as well and beyond any doubts. The music with its melancholic sounds is very suitable to the mentioned plot and the world you are playing in. The controls – regardless of whether you play with mouse/keyboard or gamepad – is quite clunky, but this doesn't really matter because there isn't much gameplay – you only need to walk and sometimes to jump.

The biggest face of the game is the atmosphere, well, it's not that at all, it's much better on the street, and in general why was there such a sharp change in the atmosphere ?! and played so well. The idea seems to be the same as the interna, but in reality ... those green, blue, brown, and red colors do not look saturated, it’s too dark. At least then they could have turned the lantern so that it could both cut it out and cut it in. For some reason, the video is peaked, as in 480P, although Korea can only be used for video. The music melted worse, or rather you don't even notice it in the background, and you can't hear it, probably because it's not as cool as in Guerrilla. In general, during the passage, I did not expect some kind of masterpiece, for at some time the end of the game is over, but by the end of the game, it was quite normal to show eb. The plot is not fully developed, it goes very quickly ... I went there, killed that one, took it away, take that. The graphics of the talus are certainly better, there is even a meta for which you still cannot get enough of it, ruins for example. Physics is finally done qualitatively, and does not look as cheap as in the previous chat. Azrusheni, finger effects, trelba, and by the way the spirit. The gameplay is as cool as in Guerrilla, a lot of new stuff, but a lot of stuff is also taken away. It’s easier to say that it’s normal, and it gets attention. ",True,False

2374,"was released in   for PC by   (however, it was previously released in Q4 2009 for PS3/X360). Back when I first played it, I didn't know what to expect mainly because the first Assassin's Creed game was interesting, but very poorly executed, but since the media was giving so much praise, why not try it? What I found was one of what I consider the best games of the previous generation. Let's begin talking about the technical part -  . The game  , and in scenes with lots of NPCs and things happening, I could feel that the game was running   (of course I will let my PC specs later to give an idea), and I can't say that the graphics still good, they're acceptable, but most of time, if you take a more close look you will see that a lot of textures are in low resolution. Anyway, the game offer options to customize the graphics if you're running in a not so powerful machine, and from what I remember, it scalate pretty well in older systems.  .  Now, about the story. It will be hard, but let me try do it in the more fast and understandable way: Back in the crusades, there was two factions fighting, the Assassin's and the Templars. Assassin's wanted to achieve peace for the mankind by giving people freedom, while templars wanted to control people with extremely powerful artifacts of an ancient civilization, because for them it was the only way to achieve peace and a perfect world. Things happened between that time and now (2010 - 2011), and those artifacts are now lost. However, a corporation called  , that is controlled by Templars discovered a method to find those artifacts -  , and so, they developed  , a machine who could  . And then, they captured  , an Assassin that had escaped from his family and was living without any connection with them as a bartender. Things happened, we now retrieved his memories from Altair, an edgy assassin that was the main character of the first game and now, because of those things that happened, we're going to retrieve another guy past, but this time is not only for the info on the artifacts, but also to train Desmond -  . Anyway, during the game, we will not follow much of Desmond story, so we are going to now talk about it's ancestor that is also my favorite character in the entire series.  was a young italian guy from 15th century, doing young italian guy things, he had a happy family, two brothers, a father and mother, and one sister, but then pretty bad things happen and he need to get away from his house and city with his sister and mother, so he run away to  , and his plan was to stay there for sometime and then go away from all that. However, some other things happen, and he decide to help his uncle to fight against some bad guys. And then for some motive he decides to stay there with his family,  . Then he go and begin to hunt down who made the bad things that made him run away in first place, and then he enter in the Assassin order, discover that his true enemy is now the Pope, and go hunt him too. Not in this exact order. Now, talking about the gameplay. During your gameplay, you will expend most of your time on Animus, since it's the main part of the game.  . Initially, you will have open access of the parts of those cities that you have unlocked so far, and you unlock more parts of the cities doing story missions, but in free mode you can go search for treasures, do side missions or just explore the cities. You also have money  , however, the most powerful armor can be only adquired doing side missions, where you search for things to unlock Altair armor, in those side quests, you need to use your skills to go up in places, sometimes with a time limit, they're like puzzles based on skill. I didn't have much problems other than controls, and even then I didn't have to try more than 3 times to get at some place, other side missions include  . You also will have some collectibles like   and some Animus bugs left by the last guy who they used the machine.  ,  . This all I need to say about it, I think. Control wise,  , and I played with a keyboard and mouse setup. Playing with this may give you some problems to get up in some places or do some more advanced parkour, but it's not too bad. The combat is also fluid, but it kinda get repetitive in late game, unless you decide to be creative and use the entire arsenal that Ezio have -   and things like it. You don't need to, but it's cool and add some diversity than just kill people with swords. Now, about it's soundtrack, there's not much to say,  . Composed by  , it just add so much to the game, like   while someone is pursuing you. It's so good. So, this is it. The Ezio story will go on in the two following games, Brotherhood and Revelations, and in a short movie that tell what happened with him after those two.   8.0/10 ",True,False

2418,"First of all, I want to express that I regret not purchasing this game before. Because while it brings back so many memories and emotions, it reminds me of why I love Chloe Price so much. You know that the game is one of the games of the Life is Strange series, but chronologically I did not think that I would be so impressed by this game. I may have tears in a few places, maybe I cried, but the point is, of course, how impressive this game is. Our character Chloe Price, the difference from Chloe we saw in the first game, here is yet innocent, younger and a little bit more. Again, I would like to point out that if you played the first game, this game does not matter much in the upcoming elections. However, I can say that the fact that we are playing Chloe makes the game better. The characters we see in the first game appear again: Frank, David, Joyce and even Max. If you buy it additionally, it's possible to play a day that Chloe and Max lived when they were little. Although we do not see Max in the game other than this, we witness that it is mentioned by Chloe many times. If we come to Blackwell Academy, everything goes the same. Victoria, as you know ... We don't spend much time here, but we still keep in touch with a few people. If you have played and loved Life is Strange before, I highly recommend you buy it. I think Chloe is a unique character. It's much more enjoyable to play through his eyes. (Yes I'm a bit of a joke to Max) There is not a single negative thing I can say about the game, which makes quality choices as always in terms of music ... I kept making noises like ""yaaaaaa"" ""offfff"" throughout the game. Since there is not much left to say, I want to end this ridiculous criticism with a quote from Chloe Price: ",True,False

2425,"It took almost a year to write the original review, I decided to rewrite it in its entirety, because it does not correspond to the Kachetva standards, which I will now present to our reviews, + I have some washing ups that I would like to show ... Well, let's blunt: The plot of Dishonored is enough prota. A court intrigue, during which the head of the Secret Puddle Hiram Burroughs hires the Whalers (a gang of assassins) to assassinate Empress Jeamine Kaldwin, which was successfully launched by Daud (the Leader of the Whalers) and his henchmen. The field of killing Hiram is the Lord Regent and takes charge of the war. am, the game for the Lord Protector Corvo Ttano, who could not party howl gopozhu, is to plunge his head into the secret conspiracies of the lolites, to perpetrate (or not) over the killers of the queen, party or destroy Dunwall and vu empire. As I already said, ama yuzhetna is quite easy to play in the game, but thanks to the detailed work of the LR, the game is really interesting. Tons of notes, books, conversations overheard (or not) will gradually reveal the motives of certain actions, raskazhet why it was so, the dates are another reason for thinking about how to go down in a particular game iteration. Dishonored has a unique visual, therefore, even after 8 years, the picture looks impressive and does not cause rejection. Dishonored's musical rebuttal skillfully sets the right tone for the price. Of course, these tracks do not eat into memory, like the soundtrack of Prey (oops), but that's not the main thing, right? I would like to split that item into 2 chats. The game gives you a lot of samples for passing certain locations. If you want, you can go through the game without getting into the eyes of anyone, without killing anyone, completely leave in the shadows. If you want, go through more noisy, and use different tools, like, skills. If you want, engage in open confrontation, cut out milestones and move on. Arkane's level game design takes this into account and provides a backdrop for the milestones. He also has soaps to thoroughly study the level, because there are many places where you can find money for pumping, drawings, notes and books that will help to open and deepen the world of the game. Let me give you an example based on personal experience. In the first playthrough, I played not too much chito, but not too much, so, I could kill someone, I could catch my eye somewhere. At the same time, I had a bunch of perks that helped me to go through certain lessons (Otanovka time, command, etc.), as the lead didn’t hiccup workarounds, so the game took quite a long time. Now, I'm going through the game on the maximum falsehood, without pumping, to reach the ""clean hands"" and ""ghost"" and you know ... playing talo is much easier. I began to hiccup secret paths, with the help of which I could pass unnoticed, more actively use the movement, as a result of which, I increased the flow of Pierrot's lekirs, which had been idle before. I saw reviews in which (all of a sudden) there was a lot of negativity in the direction of ""forced pacifism"" and ""the influence of a number of murders on the ending of the game."" Specifically, there were resentments about the fact that the game KNITS non-lethal (or low-lethal) in order to get a good ending. Well, I want to make a little surprise on that topic. Rkaine has an excellent ability to create worlds that puddle not only with decorations for the new southwest. Thanks to the lucidly overheard conversations, zapiks, books, other sources of information (the same pictures), gives the feeling that something is really infringing, lives his life, reacts to the deceit of the main character. This creates a certain atmosphere of no one ... comfort, because of which, in that game, a new and new one wants to return. Even put 8 years, even the field of the release of the 2nd chat (a review of which I will also write shortly) with dishonored additions (which should also be reviewed) is still an excellent game that I want to recommend.

You can literally tail and sneak past someone and they won't notice you. I played on the hardest difficulty: Über. It's not too hard in general, except some levels are really tough. If you stealth your way difficulty shouldn't be much of a problem. If you wan't to run and gun, then it gets difficult. I hate the supersoldiers and mechanical enemies the most, and the main character agrees with me, they are the ones that makes it difficult.

2460,"First thing to say, Deck Nine really brough us a perfect title. It was their first priority to give us something superior like this. Have to say, they have earned their trust through great accountability. But i had faith in Deck Nine. Some people were like they are gonna ruin the series or something like that. Now see what have they done, created a masterpiece. For me, first episode just overwhemled me with way too fun and emotions. Let me share more of my thoughts and about my experience on first episode on few aspects. 10/10, Went through a lot of fun and inflammation till now - Jack Story As we all know, Life is Strange is mostly about it's story. A story that would create eminent fusion with it's title. Through my experience, i have realized this story is going to it's sequences so perfectly. Like there are so much things to acknowledge and know. As it is prequel and we know what happened at the end but still they have tailored the story much more clarified. Like now i know why Chloe loves Rachel this much because the story has also illustrated her behavior and emotions as Chloe. Story has been focused to Rachel and Chloe mostly. Made Rachel more iconic and connected with the story. However it was, i found it very demonstrative. Through the story, we will know much more about Rachel and Chloe. I have seen bit of Victoria, Nathan, David, Joyce and few other characters also. We can make this story more flat out through our conversations if we want. We can be straight or askew, that's our choice. But i have chosen to be straight and found this perfect piece of whole story for me. Seems this is gonna be well-lit story. At the end of episode one, your intensions will be changed. Because there are more to see and discover. Characters and other impressions Compared to Life is Strange session one and Before The Storm, i could see some difference or maybe modifications. Characters got more facial expressions and moves. Also much more detailed. So it was kinda lovable and cool. Well, Rachel looked so beautiful among all the characters. Just like how we wanted her to be. Also Chloe seemed way too cute and innocent than before. About dialogues, word is the deadliest weapon in this word you know. So this is what has been used to push the story somehow. Some dialogues were distressful and some were simple. Every characters used different kind of dialogues with different tons. This is what makes it more perfect. Visuals Well, simply saying that visuals are little bit improved. Just like simple artwork everywhere. Actually nothing to say much about the visuals. So i'm skipping it up. So guys, my long time waiting worths something at the end and i'm recommending you another masterpiece. Just find an excuse and let Before The Storm off the chain. Just let the story blow up your mind. I personally guarantee you that you won't be disappinted for experiencing Life is Strange : Before The Storm. ",True,False

As the game progresses, it is up to us to kill everyone who lives in that house, even his father and mother.

And especially an additional word to the intro of both the Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert, which are a tribute to the installations made by MS-DOS makes band. The mission selection cinematics, the digitized maps in HD, the REMASTERIZED soundtrack with more than 120 songs between the originals, remastered and the songs recorded by Frank Klepacki in conjunction with the tribute band The Tiberian Sons. A delight for the ears and they represent the true heart of this collection. That added to missions of the expansions, of the consoles and unpublished missions. there are like 100 missions to do in total with both games! Although it is a good remake there are things that I can not make noise: - The game pulls a lot if it is installed on a mechanical disk, from what the Community Manager says that problem has been for weeks before launch and for now The symptom of the problem is sought but it is advisable to install it on a solid state disk ... All good, I bank it because I follow Command & Conquer since the time of Westwood Studios in the late 90s, but if I have to be objective, How is it that a game that despite having been remastered and is over 25 years old, needs an SSD disk to run smoothly? terrible loose end that. -Pathfinding ... you have to get the idea that he always had this problem, he did not expect them to fix it, but moderately YES he expected them to at least look at it. Harversters get stuck on a bridge, units circle a river, and can slip into the enemy base if left unguarded. And there are infantry units (from more than 6 units) that some of them may not comply with the order you give them, they get left behind from the group and you have to select it by hand ... (beware that in large numbers the infantry fires friend among them) -There is no ""Deploy"" key. There is for the Mobile Construction Vehicle, but there is no deployment key for the APC (Infantry Transport Vehicles). It's a problem, in essence for a player who lives capturing enemy facilities like I do, because the APC starts hitting when it should deploy its engineers / infantry, before it ends up being destroyed. The APC either fire or deploy, it cannot do both at the same time (and by default it always does the 1st automatically). And that is a problem that must be anticipated before entering combat. Let's see, I repeat, these are ""characteristics"" that both games always had. After seeing a video by one of the designers about the problems of handling pathfinding algorithms in an RTS I can understand it. For a new player this is going to drive him crazy. While the one who has it incorporated will know how to handle the game very well. It is a matter of practice. But handling things like this makes both games much simpler once you know how to handle it. If this is the return of Command & Conquer, the truth makes me proud, I hope to see it again very soon for Red Alert 2 and Tiberian Sun! ",True,False

2494,"This game is purely a survival game. Mn needs a lot for this game: creativity, planning your own in advance and reacting to individual situations and and and. First of all on the positive side: - varied situations - increasing degree of difficulty which is appropriate to the level + time of the player - over-ass effects (negative or positive) are given - zombies are well animated - game fun given (hours in the 3-4 digit range easily possible) - very small Turtorial for beginners - almost endless maps - very good graphics and design - handling of objects mostly great This game throws you into the deep end and you have to find your way around. No dull A to B. You have to find your way around yourself. The behavior of zombies is, for the most part, realistic. They respond to light and loud sounds. Also find people in items with smells. Of course there are also negative things ... - WIKI page doesn't do anything ... (if you have a wiki page you should update it yourself and hope that we will do it) -> here you should really read guides as a beginner (my recommendation) - sometimes extremely unfair situations (e.g.) re-spawning of zombies in the building while you are inside. - Motorbike partly buggy - Zombies who know how to kill you through doors - The turtorial can also be seen as negative. - Updates are practically completely new, although it would be necessary. Conclusion: It is still in the alpha. Probably still when we're in the grave. This game is not recommended for people looking for simple games.

2500,"Game that I can in one way or another give my point of view since I have been more than 1200 hours, I have put an end to my game cycle due to the following reasons that for the same reasons I should not consider this game as recommended that initially in My first analysis: 1. The last update has screwed up the melee combat, now the doll throws very bugeados blows that when trying to kill a wolf makes you leave from 100% life to 40% that if you are lucky (What got me out of the game temporarily). 2.- The developers lately have been more concerned about knowing which skins are the cutest to be sold in a store than when buying keys you almost always get the most shitty, than really to see what it needs to contribute on the side survival, which originally SOE had in mind to expand and improve it. 3.- Since Battle Royale or King of the Kill came out, it meant the beginning of the death of survival, and not precisely because many counter players, call of duty or other shooters have come to play just for it, but because they do not update survival, they feel satisfied when playing Battle Royale, for something they must take advantage of the game, right? 4.-And as a result of the previous point as they do not update survival, they give greater privileges to the Battle Royale and therefore they take equal advantage of the Twitchers and Youtubers who give them crates and skins to promote the game. 5.-The split or division into two games was a solution to the aspects mentioned in points 3 and 4, however they did not take into account that the products purchased (skins) would be devalued for the survival game and raising prices in KotK, for which encourages us to forget survival and get fully into the br. 6.-The optimization problems continue 7.-The way I manage to see things and hopefully I'm wrong, the developers will end up sending survival to the trash thus turning the H1Z1 into one more shooter with zombies, making the idea in a principle that they had promised would be set aside. Now there is a team for survival content, however, they are still realizing that some people are moving away and looking for alternatives, for my part my cycle in this game has ended by now.

2524,"Well, I received this game for free, Cause off my YouTube channel. All i can say is: Military simulation at it's finest. ARMA gameplay is so different and less homogenized than the other shooter games out there such as CS;GO, Battlefield, and other modern-day gunfighting games. It's a game for thinkers and tacticians. It's a game for people who are patient and who enjoy executing a well thought-out plan. Gameplay Let's get right down to the basics; ARMA at it's core is all about combined arms gameplay, meaning that compositions of infantrymen, motorized and mechanized vehicles, helicopters, support units, and CAS are all conducted in unison to perform a common goal depending on the scenario. You can charge a factory inhabited with militants with a large column of unstoppable tanks in an organized attack, or you can complete similar objectives with a small team of 4 during a night mission. The shooting is not like your classic FPS with head-tracking and ray tracing. With the massive scale of ARMA comes realism, and bullet drop, stamina, and ammunition type all change the dynamics of your weapon. Different calibers have different 'feels' to them, and equipping the proper gear for an operation is like choosing the right cameras, lights and crew for a movie set. You need proper scopes that are for your chambered caliber, you need to learn how to zero in your sights, and how to ultimately master long-range marksmanship. The shooting reintroduces the aspect of skill-based combat. Vehicles don't feel very optimal, but they do the job and they function as they are supposed to. Vehicles for each faction feel different, and they all serve a purpose, whether it's transporting ammunition and gasoline to the front lines, or conducting artillery fire missions on far away targets. The helicopter flight modules are very realistic and fun to use especially as an experienced flyer, and doing gun runs with a stealth A-10 feels even better. The AI in the game is terrible especially when in a combined arms group. Commanding feels clunky and annoying, and your AI teammates make remarkably bad decisions and don't stick to formation under certain circumstances. That's why you need to play this game with friends. Having more players in a mission with you is quite literally a fun multiplier. Picking roles and cooperation are the best parts of the game. Graphics Altis and Stratis look fantastic and the architecture and design make you feel like you are in a genuinely mediterranean location. The water is fresh and blue, and the trees shimmer in the sunlight as they are supposed to. The ground is home to a lot of detail, with rocks you can use as cover, seastacks obscuring different locations, and ruins with plenty to discover. The modelling is fantastic and the weapons are crisp and sound spectacular. The only issue is that this game runs surprisingly bad, utilizing only two cores of your processor (or something like that), meaning that you would have to play on medium to low settings if you have a lower-end system. Multiplayer It's  unless you're playing with friends. Zeus is a fantastic addon with on-the-fly mission creation, but I wouldn't think about playing it in public even once. Battle Royale is overhyped, island life is boring and requires too many mods. MILSIM is fantastic but as always there are good groups and  groups out there. Overall it's a fun game and you get a lot for your money. ",False,False

2529,"I really wish this standalone expansion was just more of the same, but it simply isn’t… while the technical aspects are retained in the same form and nothing about the quick movement has been altered, the change of setting and a drastic drop in level design quality accumulate to an awful note Oleg concluded his series on: it’s sad that I have to admit, but Rumble in the Hometown is easily the worst of all 3 games.  Whereas the base game was all about defeating ancient beings abusing their powers to hurt the innocent, the story here is almost non-existent to begin with: the Void Walker, now back on his home planet, wakes up in his oddly empty apartment to find zombies roaming the streets. What’s left to do? The only thing our nameless protagonist is good at: shoot them mother@#kers, of course! By the way, the campaign is completely devoid of any dialogue or commentary and to some degree, I’m glad that’s the case as the base game’s writing missed the mark anyway. Instead of 9 levels, you blast your way through 4 scenarios: the corset-alleys with pathetically small arenas, a sewer level (everyone loves these!), a tunnel system with even more pointless corridors and the final central park battle with an insultingly difficult boss that luckily can be dealt with quicker if you purchased the double-damage upgrade for your MP40. Mhm, about that: both the progression and firearm-enhancements are kept the same and the body count of all levels combined is probably higher than the base game, yet somehow there is just barely enough energy to max out 2 guns and only one stat column at best. There is no new guns, the laser-rifle has been left out and enemies are reskinned versions of the previous bestiary, but with less variety. The soundtrack adds a few more tracks, but continues to be the same 10-seconds-loop you’d rather turn off in the options. The majority of all secrets are items placed in plain sight and are hard to miss, thus discouraging exploration. I didn’t encounter any major glitches, except falling through the floor once: it could almost pass as a trademark easter-egg. The only positive aspect about Rumble in the Hometown is the absence of dark environments and only because I can't think of anything else. At least you obtain 20 achievements in less than 2 hours with little effort.  As for my final verdict, this DLC didn’t need to exist and you wouldn’t want to be met with such a letdown after playing through the well-paced   clone that is Void Walker. I don’t know if we’ll ever see Oleg’s work or perhaps even a third Putrefaction entry but he should most definitely continue fleshing out the foundation he established with the second game and certainly not this dismissible garbage.

At first you can still get some pleasure, but after a certain time it has no taste: always the same enemies, always the same attacks, etc. It's starting to get extremely annoying. You hear a voice saying, ""Enough, turn it off!"" Our main character, Mondo, was tried to be designed as having a personality that adolescents call ""cool"" and still could not be fucked. All the girls in the game are sick to this friend. Our strange Mondo, on the other hand, is a memory-losing friend with the type of electrical-electronics teacher in his 20s. Is it cybernetics or bio with a left arm still has a weird plug-in that I don't understand yet. He jumps around in his suit. He's neither a Samurai nor a Ronin, but the game's makers persistently and comically deify a samurai to Mondo. The strange Samurai warrior is also doing harakiri. It will protect your dignity after all. What should he do? Should he say, ""I can't do my right, I can't do it ..."" and break Mondo? No, this is the system they established, brother, man of carvings. You will die, you have no escape. The graphics are deliberately designed as if they were crayons. Extremely repulsive. Unless you fill the shit called ""Blood power"", our friend Mondo seems to be swinging a stick, not a sword, but a 5-year-old child. He swings his sword so slowly that I can't tell you. In the game, we are an institution that helps everyone and always takes their money. The chicks are coming, ""I need help."" I don't know what he says. Our Mondo is jumping right in. `` Okay, I help. '' Man, what a hell, Mondo ... If we say one, not two, not three, not at all, you did that in all of them! Neither paid the money nor ran away. You took someone to your house. Your boss laughs strangely when he can't get the money, and he should dig you. The boss is a cyborg. If he is a cyborg, the man is sleeping. Is it such a job? Why should a cyborg sleep? For those who do not know; Since cybernetic organisms are semi-machines, they do not have biological animal needs such as sleep, food and reproduction.

The world feels empty and dull. Lack of NPC's and Monsters. Cities are bland. NO action combat for all classes, only berzerker has it. was temporarily disabled without ANY notice. A big selling point was action combat, well looks like devs clearly didnt fix that before release.. This NA/EU version Dont feel different from the /kr version at all.. Makes me wonder what the hell they did all this time, feels like absolutely NOTHING.. For now, I'd definitely stay away from this game and request a refund if you bought it.

2610,"As an avid mountain biker since the early 90's, currently shredding trails & occasional bike park on my YT, I have to agree with the negative reviews here. Other than this being really the only modern mtb game in town, it does little to capture the essence of the sport. 1. Its early access. Could you imagine getting paid for incomplete work at your job? I was ranked #3, came back one day recently to play and my score was zero & my team uniforms were all gone, 125 hours of game time for nothing.  2. It's too much like an arcade game, but it thinks its a simulation. Too much like a racing game, but thinks it's like slope style with big jumps that just don't work. 3. All tracks are procedurally generated, just like real life? Yet all the tracks of the same environment feel the same. That is by far the worst gameplay feature. With real biking or racing, you get better at it by repetition. 4. Bugs, optimization, fixes ect. I could list. There are a lot but I’m done with it, see #5 5. The devs are   sjw's & believe that using the term gay makes you a homophobe, and will ban you for such words. I would still rate the game 6/10, mainly because it’s a downhill mountain bike game. Yet the beliefs of the devs drop that to a 1/10. There is no greater foundation of any modern society than free speech. Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me. The devs must have missed that day in kindergarten when they went over that life lesson. I cannot go into space, so I play space games. I am not a robot, so I play robot games. Not a soldier, so I play shooting games. I have bikes, & can ride them irl, so why play this game. ",False,False

Throw in a fan of entertainment and an advertising campaign, fill it with pretended obsession, sell it to kids, repeat it in a year. In the trailer, the games show all the best. A huge tatoo of a preacher, beautiful landscapes, krakish explosions, a companion's obstruction and a flight on an amolet. Besides, it's now in the etting of the American hinterland. The lure to which I led was stopped. I didn’t find any atmosphere of ‘that amoy’ ’in the game. the veel is actually enough for five hours, then it comes to overpower and repeat the same type of deitvi in ​​three areas of the map to meet with the next boom. The main villains must somehow frighten, motivate and keep in suspense. about that does not happen. They want to pass their stuffy, drug-addicted stories and go to the exit. Cardboard PSs, their fictitious problems, are also not remembered and do not add interest. Drowning reassurances ‘’ a head from the receiver ’’ on how smart you are, well done and generally awesome, make you feel like a 10-year-old child helping mom in the kitchen. children cannot be left alone for a long time, they can eat. Therefore, something is happening on the map. Deer fight with bears, cougars feed the rebels, ectants repavant at every step. From that madness wants to relax a little on fishing, but it is implemented here arcade than in free imulators like Fishing Planet. Oh, even so, they won't let you go fishing calmly, an enemy amelette will arrive and drop a bomb or a mad baruk will order. After all, you did it right, Alaga?

I filled the game here and I immediately found out that despite the sufficiently powerful set, I have fps problems, I would bite it and the beginning looked really bloated and luxurious, unfortunately it changed quickly and it didn't have such juice anymore.

I thought that multiplayer would save it, but it didn't save it - it was absolutely horrible for me, it might fit someone, but it's not me and today probably not many people play it anyway, do they? The end of the game forced me to ragequit and the very end of the story looks like a sequel, but we haven't been able to do it yet and it seems that we can't do it anymore, by the time I finished it it seemed a pity to me they moved me somewhere to the last places I have to play or want to play.

2633,"There are games that are not bad at first glance. about digging into them and you understand ... how bad is it! And even the fact that you get it for free cannot overlap its milestones badly. And probably without long preliminaries, I'll start with what can be called an exercise - not bad. 1 The visual design is cool. Boa looks at least intereno. Also, there are good looking locations. And cool pobnoti. 2 Variety of types. Their kids are here, and each can be useful in certain situations. now let's dull to the fan. And blessing there is something to laugh at. And I don't even know where to start. hot ... 1 Boy. They were visually good. Then the mechanics, so to say, they swallow out. Why? -They have awful muvets -They have no stages -They have huge windows for a retaliatory attack -and one tactic operates in all boachs: inflict 2-4 hits (depending on your pumping) and whine across the field like a wound broom while he tries to retaliate hit. 2 Visual hero. The hero is, as it were, the brother of all the new boas in the game. Here are just a visual difference between them ... How to show. and their background GG looks like a homeless midget in a shabby robe. 3 Broken into the trash of a combat item. about that the problem is only for those who like to experiment with a variety of game chips. So, for example, when you receive a laser gun aka kamehameha, you can forget about such a thing as blows in principle. Why? like, that thing annihilates everything, and breaks through all the enemies on the line. Not enough breaking chants? Bound Blades. Anot huge damage, do not allow most enemies to approach you and act during dodging. Which turns va into a teleporting ball of dealing damage. Or else here's a joke. You can add damage to dodge, and every time you use it, enemies will rake. you can also add a boom bon to the evasion, which suppresses the inflicting damage from the fiery shadow. This tactic is not overwhelmingly effective against the last boa. 4 The length of the game. And no, I usually praise games that can be completed in 1-2 days. Oh, for this there is one Oh! The game should be intense. Now I will try hello examples. Resident Evil 3 remake - you can go through in one evening if you try. Oh, the concentration of everyday life is so frantic in it that the field of passage is like ""fuh ... what? It took him 6 hours? .. Whoa!"" what on here? 70% of the time you are just looking for some f * cking survey bo, for further passage. So also the fact that it is not necessary to kill enemies with an ovem does not disappear. Almost all of them are quietly bypassed, even if you provoked them. Well, yes, I forgot to show. The game at the man's side (despite the fact that he was blunt mercilessly, and died like a cat) 4 hours. And let's summarize. I started thinking to indulge the game from the category: ""Oh, okay!

The asthetics were very appealing as everything is neon filled from the enimes to the dragons to the buildings everything lit in neon colors.The comedy especially some of the dialouges are really hilarious.The outlandish over the top settings with robots,dinasours is really refreshing.The length is pretty short can be completed in 2-3 hours and if trying to get 100% can be done in 5-6 hours, this might be a turnoff for some people but i absolutely love short games as time is an issue as we get older. Overall i have pretty mixed feelings for FC3 BD, i gave it a negative because of the huge disconnect between the game mechanics with the gameplay for example the hostage resuce missions are really a pain in the arse coz you have to be stealthy but its not enjoyable at all becuse of the way the mission is setup its nearly impossible to be not detected not to mention the fact you are encouraged throughout the game to blast your way though.I'd say if you want to pick it up do so when its discounted or maybe skip FC3 is a far superior game in every single way grab that if you dont already owe it.

There is a little P2Win, not excessive, just limited to flasks and chaos chests, but then there is the patron subscription which gives some pretty beefy bonuses to players that pay $15/mo. Actually it is very akin to SWTOR, and it would be just fine if it wasnt for the killing factor of this game: DOWNTIME DOWNTIME DOWNTIME. There is no point to pay for patron when you cant even play the game when you want. 2/7 days at least you will not be able to play because of downtime/overpopulation/trove servers being offline for some uknown godforsaken reason that can take up to 18+ HOURS TO FIX What is worse, when peopel come to the forums in masse, to try to get an update of when the servers will finally be fixed, they get a non information update: we are working on the problem, will post another update in 2h (which is usually late anyways) Pros: Fun, easy to pick up gameplay Captures the minecraft charm Cornerstones are a novel idea that works really well Guild worlds add more personal creativity to the game Lairs are cool Dungeons are cooler Can design your own weapons and dungeons and submit into game on the trove creations subreddit (though they will take forever to even get reviewed, since the developers are still catching up on the creations that were submitted and approved BEFORE THE GAME WAS RELEASED ON STEAM!) Cons: Inexorable amount of downtime Classes horribly unbalanced, to the point of uselessness for some classes like the Pirate Captain and the Neon Ninja (fun to play, but totally no dps or survivability, cmon) S4 rings impossible to craft The grind in this game is real, considering there is not a complex combat system 5/10 would not wait for servers to come back up again.

Music was best thing in the game and it wasn't like really good.   Best thing in the game. Soundtrack wasn't best I heard in games but it was decent enough to stand out from everything else... I don't even know what to put here... Cards? there isn't enough of gameplay to get all of the cards. Achievement? You will have to spend lots of time for them... Developers managed to screw up achievements and this game doesn't fit for achievement hunters...   Everything looks bad... From zombies to environments. There are only few types of zombies and basically they do not differ enough except bosses from regular zombies. On top of that I felt that I wasn't having enough FPS all game.  If zombies chasing you should feel that and now I felt like there is 2 different pictures of zombie changing and that mannequin is moving towards you. No thrill, no adrenaline, no threat were felt playing survival zombie shooter and this is because of poor animations.  You can't change any key bindings at all meaning that you are stuck with keys that developer chosen. AND LEVEL RESET IS R!!!!!!! come on... I reload with that button... Restarted level few times till I got used to that controls even though you don't need to reload because your clip is infinite. And I couldn't change mouse sensitivity which is really bad because it was way too sensitive for me.  You spend all game on the different flying patterns. Sounds nice? no... game developers couldn't manage to build proper zombies so they decided to make confusing levels with lots of space to fall. Yes you can see where everything ends but combined with that weirdly fast movement sometimes you just fall off.. oh and on top of that there is transparent red ground on sides you can walk on and other things you can't jump on. Just overall levels looks bad with different abstract shapes floating somewhere off map and that transparent ground makes it hard to determine end when you running.  Last level.... This was one of the worst levels I saw in any games. Moving platforms isn't fun in this game and killing zombies feels useless because they are just simple obstacle that can be easily killed. Moving between platforms and jumping on some of them is worst part. In the end I died few times just because I couldn't jump on last platform with a boss.   Brain In My Head isn't worth your time and money. All gameplay isn't fun at all, most levels are just too easy and last level just frustrating.

2665,"Hello,  This review is after playing the first 16 hours of the game or story. So what i can say is that the Story overall is a really stale and not fun experience. I know monster Hunter is now known for the greatest campaigns but like seriously. Dragon after dragon then fight this then fight that and another biest like this is just getting sooo boring doing literally the same every quest.  After 16 hours where i have to fight some monsters its just impossible to play as a solo player anymore because in order to defeat these creatures like the sand dragon you need a friend or 2 to help you out otherwise it is literally sooo time consuming to do these missions. Just another biest thats tankier dressed in another monster skin and theres your new quest wow thats just boring. You get no rewards just random pieces of the monster you fought and after 16 hours i cant forge literally everything because all items are closed off except for the really garbage ones. So you get the same quests just more tankier biests that do more damage thats basicly it. After 16 hours for me i cant defeat the sand dragon which is really sad that even the story i cant progress in. Just bullet sponge enemies taking 50 min to defeat and flying around to different locations every 2 min. Then stunning you you cant move hitting you again you get status effects and hitting you again and again without any chance to actually attack the monsters.  So that story for me is literally non existant im not hooked to any characters at all because they are just random npcs that stand around saying 2 sentences and even in my language they dont say it properly but you also have to read everything yourself. Overall rating for the story 2/10. Story at this point not playable for me since i cant defeat this beast other then drinking 50 potions and spending 50 min doing literally nothing other then doding 49 min of that time. And the best part you get 0 rewards like new weapons for example like in division. You cant upgrade anything and you are sticking with the same weapon over and over. This game sadly is really boring and i cant complete the story at least i bought it on a sale for 20 euro otherwise this is definetly not worth the standart price.  This is another game where literally you are forced to play coop or multiplayer and get help. This is sadly the trend nowaydays coop players and people with friends that they can play with get another advantage and we solo players get fu... in the ass again like always and any game currently coming out sad to see that this market is turning into that i really miss the times where you had nice stories and a great singleplayer experience except for some exceptions like god of war and 2-3 others that nailed it.

2668,"IMO this DLC is not worth 3 bucks. It is a VERY tiny map that looks like it could have been made in a day. There aren't many practical spots to hold out on and the gameplay gets old rather quickly because you'll be defending on the same one or two spots everytime. And because survival mode in general tends to get stale pretty fast. The water on this map also looks badly done. It looks cheap and very different from the water in the campaigns (which didn't look amazing either tbh). I think even asking $1 for this is stretching it.  I know there's no steam workshop support for this game because of licensing reasons (supposedly) but I can't help but think if there was, a map like this couldn't be sold. Modders would be creating stuff that would blow this away (Drachenfels as well). You look at L4D2's workshop and you have entire campaigns that are 3-5 maps long that are well-made, fun, and free. How many maps can be played in L4D2's survival mode by default? Plenty. Fatshark adds survival mode but only gives us ONE (free) map to play on? Really Fatshark?? I think you can do much better than that.  This map really should be free since it barely adds anything to the game. A little survival map is not going to help the game's longevity or get more people to play Vermintide. ",False,False

They raid servers that don't play the game how they want it, and make a mess of everything, ruining a fun time for everyone, save those who raided in the first place.

And lastly, for those fooled by the trailers and videos posted by big time Youtubers, thinking that this is a good investment for your money, don't buy it.

The in game world is boring, the game-play loop is boring, gathering up 500 pairs of broken shoes off corpses after every battle is boring. The battles are not boring, they are very very good. However the campaign is continuous rinse and repeat with incredibly  mission design. Don't know what the development team has in mind for the final game. It looks like they are hyping the modding tools and hoping that the community will be able to make a good game from the pretty awesome combat engine. Some kind of major inspiration is LACKING and needed ATM with regards to the campaign. All we have now is a very dull framework based totally on the war-band mechanic. MUCH MUCH more is needed in terms of game play content to do with trading, politics, information, and exploration. MUCH MUCH more is needed in terms of World-building, NPC interactions, companion interactions and WRITING. Also, as of 28 hours in my game is beginning to crash and freeze.

I made the call to pick up the second game when I saw it on sale for less than £7, and to be honest, it feels like almost a step backwards. I'm no golfer, but the bounces and speed of the ball on the fairways and greens are borderline comical. Even landing your ball in the centre of the fairway isn't a guarantee that you're not going to watch your ball wheeling off into the bunkers or water hazards. The short game is better than the first game, but still frustrating if you happen to find yourself between default shot lengths, as trying to swing for ~50% of your full power is a lottery - more often than it should, you'll just bunt the ball 5 yards. If you do land it on the green, be ready for a 12-15ft putt as standard, because that ball's gonna roll! Finally, the putting is... what it is. The grids for the green are a nice way of displaying the information, but doesn't really give enough feedback to be sure of what the ball's going to do when you strike it, and the glass-like speed of the greens doesn't help - don't put enough on it, and your ball's going to move about 10 feet laterally - put too much on, and watch in horror as you roll 15 feet past the hole. How do you know what's too much? You don't! I really want TGC to be a decent game, and it looks gorgeous, but this game feels like a retrograde step. If you're looking at this, take a shot at TGC1 and see if that works for you. ",False,False

By killing people as a demon, there is no way to take over the human afterwards, and therefore you won't progress to the game. The length of the role-playing game itself is 7-10 hours, depending on whether someone cares about the collectibles at least a little. In some levels there is a problem with the automatic change of FPS from fixed 60 to 30. Playing as a succubus: You go through the same locations as before, but with a HUGE ease. You can kill every creature on your way (which kills the sense of horror and survival). All doors / passages are open, so it's a real hell running simulator. You can complete the whole game as a succubus in just 2 hours, I have the impression that this mod is only to collect all the leftovers. I was expecting a game like most people, built on this controversy and brutality, but for the typical gamer who has played a lot of things, it doesn't make much frenzy. Currently, I do not recommend buying the game because it is underdeveloped. The theme of capturing monsters kills the build-up horror atmosphere that everyone talks about. The succubus mod is a real hell running simulator. It must be said here that the game had a lot of potential to use, but it's hard to get something polished when a handful of people are working on the game, Madmind Studio is not a powerful studio with a lot of money, so it's no wonder that their work is so limited. Nevertheless, the game could be masterpiece and something average was created. When the game gets patches to fix a few things and gets a little cheaper, it becomes worth buying. ",False,False

The problem is that in the meantime, there has been a hell of a change: Yeah. Two years after swearing to their great gods that there would never be any microtransactions, guess what happens ... Especially since the weapons that can be unlocked in this way cannot be unlocked otherwise and have certain stats bonuses ( unlike CSGO from which the system is based). Who Said Pay To Win? And that is without counting the mountain of DLC to buy if you are a completionist and are looking to grab all the successes (there are some in total for 107 € excluding sales), knowing that a new DLC comes out almost every month.

Yet it only does one thing right, give you a true rpg. Though only in the sense of ""well this time I'm going to use this perk/weapon"". There's no ""skill"" as most would say, it's truly just two objects flailing at each other. Just one is controlled by a program and the other a useless monkey brain, which almost always leads to the program having the upper hand (which is inherent). This doesn't mean the AI will always be better, for there is a ""learning curve"" yet its fraught and leaves you never feeling in control. Granted you can just do over head attacks and win every fight, but hows that fun (aka this is what speed runners do). Don't let anyone fool you into thinking there's skill because without an inherent combat system in place there can't be a skill level. Without a dedicated combat system every move is different from the last and no fight will ever be the same. Skill would only come down to the amount of time you're willing to waste learning the broken and honestly disastrous combat/moving mechanic.  Unless you're under the age of 18 and or have nothing better to do with your precious life I'd say just don't waste the $15. I would rather watch grass grow and pigs  than deal with this broken game.

They designed the game around the hideous/laughable combat: realized the game was naked, added arena mode, realized that gets boring really fast, decided to try a story, yet clearly no one knows what a story is dev team, so they resorted to a bland tasteless dungeon crawl (like we haven't seen this a myriad of times) that has you look in ""every corner of every room"" as it was sold to me.

2856,"Welcome to version 3 of Berlin-Spandau! Nothing has changed at all. The developer has once again learned nothing. You start from the final stop, and before the first intersection a street backdrop. Of course there are also Spandau objects everywhere. Details? - A foreign word on this card. - The bus is so-so so far. It just has to be patched again because some features are still missing. For example, the ticket printer does not have a night mode, the display in the dashboard is always unlit, so that it can hardly be seen at night. In addition, the dashboard cannot be adjusted, which was previously announced several times. In addition, the Solaris logo is not included in the release version, although the license was probably present. ... and then there was the FPS thing; Even in previews / Let's Plays by the developer and the ""testers"", a bad FPS number was noticeable in more developed areas such as Bottrop ZOB, Gladbeck Oberhof, Buer-Rathaus. The point is, the developer knew about it but ""couldn't"" change anything. An absolute lie, no wonder the FPS is so bad there. The Bottrop central bus station consists of terrain & invis splines. In addition, up to 11 buses sometimes stop there at the same time. Traffic rules are not observed at all by the opposing buses, as well as everywhere else on this map. The cars keep ramming me from behind when I'm at a bus stop or a traffic light, the buses ramming me at the Bottrop central bus station, because they just pull through it inconsiderately, people fly over the map, run into buses, the traffic density is clearly too strong at 100% , sometimes kilometers of traffic jams caused by the lack of traffic regulations, and much more. However, nothing has been changed there. Although you knew everything. According to the creator, the map was already ready in August. The release date was only delayed because of the bus (which is unfinished). You should have used this time to check the map for errors. It cannot be that so many errors were not recognized! - The testers also tried to show off stupidly on Facebook or drive the bus on other maps. The argument with the ""50 lines"" and the realism is also nonsense. Of course they exist, but they are so unrealistic. Examples: 188: We don't need to talk about it at all. ;) 979: Turning right after horse market is almost impossible, and the mountain up is much too steep. The coolest thing is the developer's inability to criticize. If you say something negative, he literally sticks his fingers in his ears and does lalalalala; I can not hear you. He just doesn't want to hear about suggestions for improvement that cost him time. And before the mice get here; No, I'm not rushing for the OmSi forum and I wasn't sent by Janine either. I was kicked out of the OmSi forum myself 3 years ago because of a stupid statement. I don't care about the dispute between Gladbeck / OOF either. I am not partisan, nothing. I am only evaluating what I have here. And that's just rubbish in my opinion. Conclusion: Once again, it was all about money. The people were once again ************. Do you want a nice card, then take a look around in the OmSi forum. There are many more beautiful freeware cards than this one for 35 €. Good payware add-ons are, for example, the Hamburger (T & N / HC) and Aachen. You pay 35 € for a renewed Berlin-Spandau in a fictional version (comparable to ""NewBerlinSpandau 1.4""), and an as yet unfinished bus, but the basic structure is good. Nevertheless, I would rather forego than pay 35 € for a bus that is currently not ready. If you needed more time, you should just have taken it instead of releasing something. ",False,False

We haven't talked about leveling players into games yet, it would take millions of years to count down to the corresponding number that dictates how many games I've played against people with more than 2,000 hours on the enemy team and players with less than 50 on mine, it seems unfair, but normally in your team there is always someone with few hours, the leveling must be fair, no! Normally on your computer there will be 2,000 hours, a couple more with 600 - 900 and the remaining two may have around 100 - 200, on my computer I usually have 1200 hours in my Hi-Rez account that I use to play and the rest of my team, hopefully, I have one who knows how to buy items, most of the time they don't know and I have to say over chat ""Press the letter I to buy items and improve your statistics in game.""

2917,"Richard was a simple minded boy. As a kid, he liked to play video games, he liked that feeling of empowerment when he shot enemies left and right in the latest Call of Duty. He liked to have fun. Life was simple. Then Richard discovered achievements on Steam and his life took a turn for the worse. Now his games had this phallic bar below their titles, and as boys do he wanted it to be as long as possible. But it was often hard to get it fully erect, with no achievement left undone. All he wanted from video games was fun. Life was already challenging enough with a name like Richard after all. This changed some months ago though. Richard discovered that more and more cheap games appeared on Steam that featured a massive amount of achievements. And best of all, achievements you got for basically doing nothing at all! True, those games were not good or fun, but gaming had ceased to be about fun for Richard long ago. He wanted those numbers, he wanted them so badly. And now he could have them, more than he ever dreamed of, with little to no effort! In some of those games all he had to do was press a single key over and over again. Heck, not even press it manually, he just went out into his parents' garden and fetched a stone which he placed on the keyboard. At one time he even had a wet dream about that stone, after a fulfilling day of thousands of new achievements. Then Richard came across Drive-By Hero. More than 5000 achievements made him instantly buy it. And it was even a shooter! He used to like those. Of course the game was utter trash, cheap assets lazily cobbled together, the gun sounded like some stapler gone on a rampage, the gameplay was even worse than he expected. Three levels, one boss. The introductory message sounded like the dev had voice-recorded it himself with a cheap webcam. But he had stopped caring about things like that by now. He just wanted those achievements. So Richard played. His trusty stone wouldn't do for this though: every time he died, he had to press the mouse button to start firing again. He had already played for hours and still was only halfway through firing all those bullets. While he stared and mindlessly shot at the hordes of zombies approaching him, his mind entered a zen like dream state. He remembered those good shooters, the fun he had. After a while, with nothing else to do, he even began questioning the game's logic, how zombies running into his tank could cause him damage, or why he kept staring in the same direction although his tank made a turn. He moved the crosshairs up and tried firing at the full moon instead, to not have to look at the barren monochrome areas or the cheap zombies anymore, but the crosshairs stopped just a few pixels below the moon, unable to ever reach it, and he died too quickly that way as well. Richard fired away at those zombies for what was beginning to feel like an eternity. The image of the approaching hoardes of the undead dug deep into that simple brain of his. Once in a while, a tear would roll out of his unblinking eyes. Ever so slowly his mood would get worse and worse. What was he doing with his life? After a while the zombies and he became one in Richard's mind. Finally, his face expressionless, he stood up, grabbed that heavy, trusty stone and went into his parents' garden once more. It was night time by now, and as chance would have it, a full moon was up, forever unreachable in that beautiful, clear night sky. He slowly, mechanically got down on his knees and raised the stone above his head. With force he brought it down, time and time again. He fastened his grip in determination as the stone got slippery from his own blood. Then the deed was done. The pain was over. As his consciousness faded into the void between the stars, he was finally at peace. This is Richard's story. Don't let it be yours. ",False,True

If you were to fix all these issues then it'd be playable but there have been dumb changes or accidental problems that make the game take away control from the player's hand like some jump inputs not registering and randomly falling for no reason. There has been time to fix the game and make monumental differences but after the devs trying to address the problems by responding to them then purposefully ignoring the biggest problems it makes it clear that before adding more ongoing constant content it'll take them ages to address the groundbreaking issues. In season 2 after a long season we got: -A new   dlc for 5 dollars -4 new maps -Random graphical changes that make the map worse for the colorblind and seems to be viewed as worse than the originals -A new mode sort of The new mode focuses on removing the thing people ask since day one. Team modes. This was my favorite part of the update but was quickly ruined by the most questionable choice.  . This has been brought up over and over again but why not make it the mode people like most or even have all of them have the same chance?  I could go on and on with this but although it seems good the devs here are out for money and have little care for the experience. I was taken aback when I noticed the most interesting and worked on skins showcased in their videos would be dlc only. I've won 12 matches and at least each finale once and as others said it gets   especially when you've won them all.  . ",False,False

You enter through a massively difficult race, you get a little panic at the beginning and reduce the difficulty to easy. Because you cannot change the difficulty during a season, the game is no longer challenging after 3 races and a short familiarization with the physics. Some sort of ""automatic difficulty"" would be optimal. You deliberately screw up qualifying so you can overtake a few more cars. It's the little things that frustrate you without end. It starts with the race control blaming the player for every collision, even if the AI ​​drives you in the back. If you crack and the car breaks down, you go into the automatic flashback and continue the race, so you make a 15-second journey into the past and go on. The contract changes are completely ridiculous and far from reality, after half of the season Grosjean suddenly drives at Racing Point, Hamilton has switched to Ferrari and Russel drives for Mercedes. Apart from a yellow flag for 10 seconds because some engine breaks down, nothing happens. No safety car, no accidents, no termination of the race, no restart or the like. In between you get a brief notification by radio: ""Brief information about XXX, it seems to be a serious problem, you are giving up"". And then there were only 19 drivers. It's like any other Automobile Sim, only with better graphics. You only get to hear the same rubbish over the radio. You also have no freedom of choice as to which supplier you buy which parts from. As an Alfa fanatic, for example, I can't decide whether I want a Ferarri, Honda or Mercedes engine. I can only buy new ones when the old ones are down. I'm in my second season now and the game is just sucked out. The multiplayer can be trashed like in any racing simulation.

I love these (no). Third: an incredible clan update. Clubs, good things. It costs quite a lot, not even the top one (1.7kk for a club in the center without any pumping), to which you also need to buy expensive treasures and technicians, who, as it were, will provide you with a profit. + share earnings proto for the work of the club. e bad, like, huh? Like howling business. I spent money and expect profit, but no matter how it is. In order for the technicians to work, you need an over of many enterprises, which, in turn, takes about 9k per day for their maintenance (for catching, in one game day, they propose an average of 30k), at the same time for 1 game day, thanks to the technicians, you can recoup the costs of the undertaking, but do not forget that some pid ..

The good roktar promised to give us 1kk + 1kk for completing it with one aftermath + bon for the first playthrough for completing all robberies.

There is little variety in the questions, Skellige did not take it out at all, it is a very tedious task - to close a bunch of questions in the water, ride a boat, sweeping teleports to the city to sell loot, and also to find a new boat. Practitioners do not give us experience for studying, there are no problems with money. • - Spoonti practically useless, tried different tili bo, but went to one - hit + somersault. You pump in a whirlwind and hammer into pumping. lhmimi? e need. Zel? I did it a couple of times, it is useless further, by evading you and so you will pass anyone. For the dark, a torch. The topic of gaining experience depending on the level is nonsense, it is impossible to calmly study the map, you get pennies, but as you did all the side things and went to do it - they throw you eight levels for half an hour playing in the southern quet. Ballet is not needed, signs are iterative. regeneration - pumped in a skill, bought a block and one block of 20 minutes of real time heals you. Very interesting. • - I've already mentioned the levels above, but here it is worth mentioning the balance of those questions. You run according to a certain logic, you clean the ""vector"", the hop is a level 10 enemy. Hop is already 12 levels. Hop - 8 levels Vyo well, they are about your level. then suddenly, between the questions having opponents of 10 and 12 levels, he finds an opponent of 18 levels, who lays down to you with one poke. I came to see unclosed points, which, over time, I just didn't care. Another thing to mention is boiling - you can easily throw out craft from the game except for crafting gear from different schools. It is not necessary, it is useless. I went to the drawing of the school and gradually craft swords depending on the level. And why there are millions of drawings for vkie mediocre guns - it's not clear. On the rarity, too, dregs, and did not make out the coolness of each ""color"". It seems to be a legendary weapon, but it is more labile than usual, which is not much higher in level. In the end, I tried to study half of the game as much as possible, but the number of side quests is not so huge, in the end it came to return to the south. Returned and killed ve interest in the game. I reached about level 22, having closed almost Velen / Ovigrad on issues, Skellige hardly touched in the water. He passed the defense - raised in half a hour to level 28. Very interesting. Twenty hours of running around and grinding in a mess, for which they gave pennies, which lead to nowhere. I won't say anything about the graphics and bugs, the graphics didn't interest me, and the bugs ... had jams and stupidity. I don’t remember what came out in 2015, but I would have given the game of the year to that game with ntzhkoy. to read it as a masterpiece and pass it more than twice - then I read it as a disease.

It's easily one of the worst moments in any half life game. - The story is so  bad it's infuriating, why is almost every character wrote to be retarded? You HAVE to warn White Forest Base that a massive army of Combine forces are attacking them, however, you have to save Alex from dying, but do so in the worst possible location, resulting in tons of time, that, while fun to play through, make no sense on a story writing level. Then you get the car so you can get to white forest faster, which makes sense, however you are expected to stop to pick up useless supplies that are entirely unnesscary, and the puzzles to get a 40 health pack and smg ammo (which on a side not, why is pistol and smg ammo so common, those weapons are almost useless!) only exist to increase gameplay time and make zero  sense from a story perspective. There is a limited amount of time to warn the base, why is Alex wrote to be literally retarded and to waste as much time as humanly possible? Just kidding, it turns out, that while they did get to the base and the base had no warnings, it actually didn't even matter, because they were ready for them anyway, so the story built up how much of a threat they were for absolutely no reason. 2/4, the only reason to play it is because it's part of the half life storyline.

3034,"Door to Door is somewhat of a detective exploration game but lesser. You play as Bixby, an agent of the Ministry of Order. You basically go around the city investigating crimes (not really). The truth is, you follow clues and just interact with them. You don't need to think most of the time, just walk around wishing that you get to your objective because you just want to get it over with. The world is boring and lifeless. It is a world governed by robots and I find no humans or anything like that (well I didn't really play till the end cause it was killing me, honestly.)  I hate giving bad reviews to games because I know the developers worked hard on it but this one is not really a ""full game"" in my opinion. It lacks flavor, colors, and fun. The world is bland and big, you spend most of the time wandering it and you'll get bored. There are no subtitles in the game and I read a post by the developer that there will be no subtitles coming anytime soon (I think its because of the engine or something). There is also no way to review clues, when you press ESC you just have the options to go to settings or quit the game. The inability to review clues bothers me so much. I mean, its tagged as detective but you can't review your case files. If this game is on early access, I may have followed it because the concept is nice. The graphics is a great (it is basically the best thing in the game). But Door to Door is not on early access and it still feels incomplete. Additionally, I think the price is too high for this game. The characters are alright but there are so few. You have yourself, your assistant, charizmo (he's the guy to ask for directions), and depending on the case you are currently on, some few more characters. It would have been great if there were a bunch of characters in the background. I mean there is a bar, it looks great  and classy but its empty. There is a market also empty. A  bus station, guess what, that's right, its empty. There are some characters who just stand there and when you try to interact they just say ""hello"" or ""don't mind me"" but they just make me hate the game even more. The good thing in this game as I have said is really the graphics. It is well done and you'll find the environment design amazing until you realize that the world is empty and it becomes dull. The sound is fine, I guess, but it still gives no life in the game. Imagine you're in all alone and you here the clarinet music in the detective movies. Wouldn't you feel so lonely?

This review is in no way applicable to newcomers, and I fully recommend buying this if you didn't already own DkS2. Tl;dr here: I strongly discourage people from buying this game, due to two reasons. 1. You cannot transfer old saved data. This means that that character you spent 250+ hours leveling, gearing and upgrading? Yeah, you won't have access to him/her anymore. Bad luck, mate. The worst thing about this is that they choose to pass this off as ""impossible, due to the DX9 to DX11 upgrade"", which I know is utter bollocks. I could transfer my saved files from several other games, including Serious Sam, Titan Quest, multiple Resident Evil titles etc.  2. If you're a Dark Souls achievement  like myself, you will have to grab every single achievement again. That means venturing to NG2+ in order to obtain spells like Wrath of the Gods, Great Chaos Flame and more.  Sloppy  like this is not okay, From Software. A final note: While my in-game play time will read about ~1 hour for this game, don't be fooled. I have around 260 hours into the old Dark Souls II, but due to this being an ENTIRELY NEW LAUNCHER, for whatever bloody reason, it doesn't count those hours.

Forgive me the bad Pun, It will definetely be Fun, But from Hawai, passing through Sinai and going back to the guys that say Banzai, The AI does not satisfy...  They still cannot manage supply! EXTRA SIDE NOTES: The DLC does include a brand new spanish, portuguese as well as a reworked french tree. Which is good. But as usually, Paradox fails to notice what is important about certain countries, like Portugal. I could speak about countless things, but for instance if it wasn't the community complaining during their dev diaries, Salazar, the one that actually controlled the nation for the entire game's timespan wouldn't even have a focus tree in the political sense, unlike anarchists which for example weren't more than 200 people in total by this time (ridiculous I know). There are also 0 sprites for Generals, Units, Admirals, etc for Portugal (so we have to play with default portraits! shameful). As a result I decided to publish my own mod about Portugal in the next 1-2 weeks. I have been working on it for countless months already. It is definetely more historical, detailed and most likely more entertaining than Paradox's tree for the same country. Be sure to follow me and subscribe the mod (once it becomes available) if you are interested in an improved Portuguese Historical Work! IN-GAME REVIEW: Coming Soon... But as you can guess, 20€ for the content being offered is a joke, specially since the AI - is still unable to manage supply, like my review stated. We will have to deal with Russia losing countless men because they are way over the supply limit, losing equipment in the process in huge quantities, for now. I bet Nazi Germany will, steamroll Russia most of the times as a consequence, but I hope I am wrong. EDITED (a bit too late I know): As you can imagine, Germany is still too OP and Russia always gets steamrolled easily. They simply cannot cope with the heavy losses and the loss of equipment (in many cases, due to supply!!!). The DLC is pretty well overpriced in my opinion, and spying pretty redundant in most cases unless you got a lot of independent nations on your alliance, which is quite rare and usually only (sucessfully) achieved as a nation belonging to the allies (usually as the UK itself since you can release countless nations as independent and make them join your alliance).

3121,"A quick mention that I would recommend is STEEP, I play Steep on Xbox One and it costs money but it is worth every cent. No P2W bs or anything like that, you get what you pay for. I may only have 30 minutes on this game but those 30 minutes were the worst 30 minutes of my life. Plus I have more hours of this game on my other account and the game was not enjoyable then either. I will get into finer details about these points below in a minute but here are the basic problems. Snow says its free, it's really not. Snow has horrible mechanics. Snow has been in early access for over 4 years and it's still trash. So when I say Snow isn't actually free, what do I mean? Well you see back when I first played Snow on my other account, you could play on many maps (only 1 was good). But now the free game gives you 2 maps one of which being the worst map ever in any video game. The only way to unlock these other maps is a montly microtransaction called ""Ski Pass"". These are absoulutely rediculous as they are very pricy and it is a subscription! When I say Snow has horrible mechahnics I MEAN it has horrible mechanics with all my heart. Snow says it is strongly reccomended to use on a controller yet it is not on any console and you would think they would make a Steam game better for a keyboard right? Well of course not you dummy! The controls on this game are horrendous and just feel broken. I believe that SNOW should have at least started out on a console before it came to Steam with all its bulls**t. I also hate the fact that when the edge of your snowboard/ski/snowmobile touches a tree or a wall etc etc you just fall and f***ing die. Horrible. My final point on why Steam is S*** is the fact that the game has been out for 4 years and has only gotten worse, The game origionally started out as a DECENT game where you could go on snow transport on huge mountains and small towns, over the past four years of development, there hasn't been anything that has been made better, everything has just gotten worse.

Although I did manage to complete it, it wasn't without some serious issues. Several times I got stuck in various ways that prevented further progress - sometimes it was a matter of a game event not triggering properly, and sometimes it was due to going some way the game wasn't expecting me to (apparently). I also encountered issues where the controls would just stop working for no reason. Restoring to the last checkpoint sometimes fixes the issue, but this is rarely the case. Most times, there is no choice but to start the level (or entire chapter) from scratch. Do you know how annoying it is to have 30-40 minutes of progress wiped out, have to start over again, and hope you don’t make the same game-breaking mistake again (whatever it was)? Let me tell you - it's really f%@*&g annoying. I ended up having to do that multiple times. And would you believe, as a final bug-ridden cherry on top, the very end of the game also glitched out on me as well? Well, believe it. So on top of all the other frustration I experienced just getting through the game, I didn’t even get to see the full conclusion of the story.  Now, putting all of that aside, what’s actually good about Beatbuddy? Quite a bit, actually. The hand-drawn layered 2D graphics look great, the controls are responsive, the puzzles are generally well-designed, and the music is decent. And that’s a good thing, because the music plays a large part in the gameplay - the environment works in time with the beat of the music, requiring specific timing to pass obstacles or solve puzzles. The first couple of hours are great, as the basic mechanics are introduced. Unfortunately, it starts to lose its luster a little bit after that, as most of the subsequent puzzles are pretty much variations on things you’ve already done several times. So you might start to get tired of it after a while (or maybe I was just burned out from having to replay several areas). I would estimate the overall playtime to be somewhere around 4-6 hours. Overall, the game is not bad, and I enjoyed it while it was working properly. The frustration from all of the technical issues I had just ended up being too much for me to give it a full recommendation. If you enjoy action/puzzle sidescrollers, music-themed games, and/or games with pretty 2D artwork, it’s definitely worth a look. Just be aware of the potential issues. I suppose it could very well be possible that you'd encounter no glitches at all… but I doubt it (several posts in the Steam forums seem to corroborate my experience). At the very least, don’t buy it at full price unless the developers hire more QA people and/or release a patch that fixes the game-breaking issues. ",False,False

3165,"The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a Diablo inspired action RPG developed by NeocoreGames. The game is set in Eastern Europe where magic and science fiction coexist. You get to play as the son of Van Helsing from the original Dracula novel. In this game, you find yourself in Borgova, which is plagued by monsters and it is your job to hunt them down, and free the land. This quest will take you through several areas like swamp forests, mines, sewers and elaborate futuristic steampunk cities. There is a lot of variety in level settings. You also get a ghost companion, Lady Katarina. There is some banter between the main character and the companion which can be funny at times, but most of the times, its just cliches. I felt that some of the abilities for the companion were either not very well developed or not well explained. For example, I have never seen the  companion use a melee weapon, yet you could equip the companion with one. I am not sure why... That said, having a companion is very useful, not just during combat, but for doing tedious tasks such as selling items. Just like in Torchlight, it is possible to add items to the inventory of the companion and send her off to town to sell them. The gameplay got very tedious towards the end of the game. In the beginning, there is a learning curve, and its fun experimenting with different abilities, but halfway through the game, it becomes very stale, because there is not much else to discover in terms of abilities, and the loot becomes pointless because I already have the best weapons. By the end of the game, I had over 700,000 gold, and there was nothing to spend it on. This would have been fine if the combat didn't get to repetitive. Combat generally involves a large mob of enemies rushing your position. Not necessarily a bad thing, but more often than not, the mobs are very unfair. Often times I found myself overpowered, and no combination of abilities and weapons allowed me to defeat the mobs. It is possible that I could have made a mistake in points allocation, but I felt as if these sections are created to be unfair. In addition to this, the game has these narrow levels with tall obstacles (such as pillars) which obstruct the view and it can make combat more frustrating in certain situations. At times there are 20 enemies all firing at the same time, and there is no way to retaliate except pick off a couple of enemies, die, respawn and retry. This is not fun for me, and its not good design in my opinion. The game does not seem to take the story very seriously, its laced with anachronistic references, intended to be humorous, I am sure, but it got old, and unlike Diablo, there are no memorable characters to be found here, except for the main character and the companion. This is a bit of shame because the game had a lot of potential, but just did not capitalize on it. I am sure the humorous take on the vampires and mad scientists might appeal to some, but I was hoping for something different. I purchased this game as part of Humble Jumbo Bundle on August 20, 2014 for $1. I got this game along with others as a part of this bundle, and for that price, you can't really go wrong.

3292,"I read through the negative reviews, I thought I could stomach the weaknesses of the game compared to the earlier Anno games because of the interesting parts Anno 2205 had to offer. I was wrong. More than anything else, I really miss setting up the elaborate transport routes that I used for the previous Anno titles. Now it's just a very bland pulling a few sliders and resources are automatically transferred from one zone to another for a small fee. Not a single ounce of creativity in it. Your people in one zone demand a good that can only be made in another zone. You create a supply of that good in that other zone, and then pull the transport slider, then you're done. I will say that significant improvements to the naval combat game were made, but it plays more like its own distinct mini-game rather than as a cohesive piece of the larger game as a whole. The only challenge of an Anno game that is really left in here is being able to do the best you can in effectively tiling your islands with various to maximize your space utilization and minimize any wasted space. This is a well implemented mechanic, and it was done at least as well as it was in the previous Anno games. Do yourself a favor and pick up Anno 2070 instead if you're interested in this. And if you choose to ignore my advice and buy this game anyway (hey, I did it too, I won't judge), you should also know that the DLC kinda does help to make Anno 2205 a more complete game, but it also does inflate the pricetag that much more.

3321,"The Cooking Simulator [my favorite Simu of 2019] with its DLCs and free additional game modes is one of the best games of 2020 for me as a big simulator fan. And I want to like the pizza content, yeah I love it, but the content is full of bugs. Unfortunately. I dont get any further. The mistakes overshadow the really great pizzeria. * Howl * Our pizzeria looks credible, lovingly designed and well thought out. We have the ingredients cellar, which makes my mouth water every time I see all the delicious meats, cheese and other ingredients lying / hanging there. It's fun to help yourself there with a basket in hand. Graphically very demanding. In the preparation room, we mix the ingredients for different types of dough together, have it cut into pieces, mix our sauces and cut all the ingredients into small pieces with a machine or grate the cheese. (we don't need a knife). Our spices thrive wonderfully. The shakers, e.g. for salt or pepper, can now pour out 10g at a time, yes, we mix in larger quantities. Everything fits, is beautifully designed, has flair, the best thing about this room is that we have a device to push the individual containers for the cut ingredients through the wall into our main room. Practically. In the main room we take orders, 5 a day, all without stress, although there are points for speed, but that is fair and even if we are lame, we still get 4 stars if we were accurate. We roll the dough, distribute the sauce, top it according to the customer's wishes (hopefully we made good use of the infinitely long preparation time!), Sprinkle with cheese and then we fire the stone oven with wood. After baking, the pizza is placed on one of the 3 plate sizes and sold. I would have liked to serve the customer at the table. Because when we look out the windows, we have a really beautiful terrace right by the sea, a dreamlike backdrop. Oh yes, the windows and shutters can be opened. There are again a few abilities to unlock, all small useful things, you can always choose more ingredients, but you don't lose track like in the endgame of the main game. Recipes can be pinned again, there is hardly any time stress. There is also a sandbox mode, but I always play career. Yes, you can see, I'm raving about this game again and only praise it where I can, that is also appropriate from the atmosphere and credibility of the game, if it weren't for the many mistakes. Most of the topics in the community deal with mistakes. And poor performance. Even with a suitable graphics card, the game often stutters, it hangs almost every time the pizza is occupied, otherwise I had no problems. But the mistakes. Ingredients fall through the basket, plates fly across the room, the pizza falls through a cupboard, ingredients jump out of the ingredient container. My biggest mistake at the moment is that I can't deliver the 29th or 30th pizza, it falls through the sales trigger and lies in the wall. As a result, I cannot hand in any more pizzas, game breaking bug. It's not running that smooth yet, I know of other bugs that I haven't (yet) had. The German translation, however, is almost perfect and correct. I praise the Cooking Sim wherever I can and stand by it. I would also very much like to recommend this content, would also do the same in terms of content, because the pizzeria has charm and it's a lot of fun. But I would like to show the developer that he still has a lot to improve here and therefore cannot (currently) make a recommendation, due to the errors and the fact that even players with better GraKa`s have enormous performance problems. I myself have to load an older savegame first to get further. When the bugs are gone, there is definitely a thumbs up, the price of 10 € also suits me. Thanks for reading :) I would meanwhile change my negative rating to positive after 3 patches! (Unfortunately, all previous ratings would then be removed ......) Thanks also: ((Reason: The developers are very active in the forum, respond directly to the criticism and have published 3 patches in less than a week, all of them so far solved my bug reports and problems.

The player will control a crab (also including lobster, down), wield huge tongs, and fight with the opposite crab. The perspective is a third-person rear-end view. There are 9 crabs sold in the shop inside the tour, including snow crab, steamed crab, long-arm crab, crab hair, red stone crab, lobster, Australian red crab, coconut crab. The snow crab is a one-piece crab with a relatively round shape, large claws and long legs. Steamed bread crab, this crab with a shape (note and round), although the tongs are large, but the arms are very thick. Long-armed crabs, very snow crabs, the arms are very long, much longer than the legs on the sides. Crabs have thick and long arms, a very short body and short legs. Hairy crab, this crab is close to the accurate crab image, but too many spots on the body. Redstone crab, long-armed crab has short arms and long legs, that's it. Lobsters have huge pincers and movable tails. The Australian red crab, Oye, is the most accurate crab image. Coconut crab, this strange animal is actually a hermit crab. What has been compared with other hermit crabs is that it did not get into the snail shell. Having said that, I found that some regular crab watching or edible crabs are not available. For example, the fiddler crabs used for viewing, the fiddler crabs, special note that the fiddler crabs have two hands. Edible hairy crabs and swimming crabs. There is also the world's largest crab, a crab, a spider crab. There is no long-arm prawn painted by Shiraishi. There is no mantis shrimp (pipi shrimp) that I think should appear. The mantis shrimp’s ""punch punch is great. And I also like hermit crabs that can show up with a snail shell. Of course I said these, without considering The real animals are big. The red crabs are not all cooked. For example, the regular sashimi crabs are red. If you think that real crabs fight like this, then you are wrong. I also raised sashimi crabs. People, although I haven't raised crabs to shed their shells, I know how crabs walk, how to fish, and what things are. The four pairs of legs of crabs in the swim are all moving, and the whole crab looks swaying, which is completely correct. The four pairs of feet on the sides of a crab should be similar to human fingers. Although they are separated, they are more suitable for moving together. Some people would say that crabs should walk horizontally. Crabs can actually walk, and they do not walk fast. The biggest foot in this swim is the crab’s eyes. The crab’s eyes are laid down or up, and there is no such movement during the swim. And there is no movement of the crab part. The crab is an arthropod, in the process of fighting In the middle, or walking in places too, the limbs can be broken. This is a very important point, I think it should be the lack of swimming ability in this question. Inside, the crabs still use the weapons that they use, which adds to the swimming. It’s fun. I use the controller to play, and almost all the keys need to be used. The keyboard has not been tried, and the keys should be more troublesome. The picture quality of this game is at the level of PS3, ordinary realistic style, no useless Polygons and the like, so it looks rough. For some reason, the fonts in the world are often rudimentary, and it feels like a copycat. Although it can be used to express the wind of sand sculptures, but the fonts are rudimentary. Many people play, but also online battles. ",False,False

3493,"This is a failure. No, ""failure"" is not the kind of charm that would describe my feelings. This is proto pi * dec. The game came out after 10 months of the second chat, and was planned as a DLC. As a result, you got a separate game, which cracked one half of the chips and threw out the other half of the chips, and the other proto and fucked. Okay, she will try to spell out the voyages. Plot: Billy Lerk from the second chat decided to find his teacher Daud (who does not know, the murderer of the empress from the first chat) in order to buy the guilt of the war. The field of his finding, she gets the poorer and most important thing in her life - to kill the Alien. As you understand, without the first and second chats, you have nothing to do here. Peronages: I'm not a ravine, if I ate it seemed that during the course of the game I felt one Alien, and in the end I made a choice in his party. Why should I help hired killers, against whom I played the first part, and whom I despised in the second? A stranger helped me in previous chats, was a traveler to Corvo and Emily, sometimes even helped out, and now the game tells me: ""Dude, we know that this is a key character in the silent games, we know that you love him, and now go and kill him . Why? Um, well, oh-he caused a lot of trouble, here, there he was doing a cult around fucking, yeah. "" Okay, if the game would try to show positive tones of silent killers, but no, the game shows only those tones that, in theory, cannot cause positive emotions. And then why shouldn't I give a fuck when the main characters have problems? And they mocked the Alien too. The one whom he read as someone extraterrestrial, powerful, was made a trifle who humiliates before the utterly insignificant by equal to them. A stranger is a god, he knows the secrets of many generations and peoples. oh, here's a bunch of some assholes who decided to kill him, and he started flowing. Either he makes a new hand, then the sword that can destroy him will be given away, then he will begin to justify in the stupidest way: ""have all the sacrifices been made?"" For opening the peronages 0/10. Graphics: The same graphics as in the second chat, maybe the textures in some meta were corrected. And you won't see anything new in terms of the grafon here. Setting: The same islands, only now we are running along some monotonous streets, in some meta we have been in the second chat, but you no longer get such motions. In Dishonored 2, I wanted to climb every corner, every lane, to sink into every apartment, because somewhere I could get lost, somewhere to communicate with the same Aliens, and now that is not there. Although, that topic is already for the next point. Chips: This is my favorite part. The arabs were so wrong that I didn't even know where to start. Okay, the first is the rejection of runes and altars. I don't know if you can imagine Dishonored without quiet stuff, personally not at all. For the sake of which he climbed every house in the second chat, they took it and threw it away. For that, we were given a couple of tips from the very beginning of the game and they will hiccup some fucking amulets that I personally neglected in Dishonored 2. This only aggravated my opinion about the already poor * game. Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider's coffin has been rejected by the haoa. at that proto pi * dec. You can come to any location, draw all bots in one room, sentence each draw to quartering, quietly bring down from there and we will absolutely shit. The game only motivates you to go further along the next fucking locations, to the fucking degenerate bots with Down's indromus, which at a high level of falsehood will trell into the shadows if they tell you. at the end of the game, heroin can outright change his mind about the main ""antagonist"" of that game. How many pathetic phrases were shown in the Alien's adra, how many times Billy and Dowd called him ""black-eyed bastard"", and in the end she is ready to go to his side with ease, about catching ""he didn’t give a deed, he’s good,"" Dowd will call him ""poor girl"" in all seriousness. Once I heard it was a proto in a * ye, from the fact that the vu game to only heard about how good it would be to dunk the Alien. I don't know what kind of hard drugs the Cenarites were using, when they drank that ... You know, but from that idea I could give birth to a good spin-off with new internee characters, put a couple of kids years, when an Alien could really become a really negative hero, triple a full pi * dec on the Otrovnaya Empire, when the povit is a gang of protetants, etc. Even Yeicha may not have come up with the most original idea, but it would have been better than what came out. This is the only game that I played with a deep feeling of ""come on, come on, come on, finish already"", and this is one of my favorite series of games in general. after all, that game has better reviews on Steam than Dishonored 2, although half of the chips in Dishonored DOTO were fed from there.

3502,"Hoo boy, where to begin.  This game is most likely a scam, and we can safely put the blame on steam greenlight. You have four choices when you first begin; Procedual Space, Planet Zero Sandbox, Moon Sandbox and Vehicle Testing Sandbox. Let's take a look at each one, shall we? ~~~~ Procedual Space;  I spy with my eye 5 vehicles inside this.. spaceship? I've yet to figure out how to enter the big mecha, not even sure if it's possible. The other 4 is flyable. With that said you might have to use a pretty darn long time to enter 2 of those, as you have to aim and shoot the panel in order to get inside.  And then there's the flying, my first try got me stuck in the roof, 1 minute of twisting, turning, upside-down rolling got me loose.  <Song break:  Upside down Boy, you turn me Inside out And 'round and 'round> My second try on the other hand got me outside the spaceship, and into .. nothingness. I flew towards a planet, in hopes of something happening, just anything, please. But no, I flew right through it. There seems to be a marker 104440KM away, but it took me 4 minutes to fly 10.000KM. So no, no. I'm not.. Several minutes later; It was the same  spaceship I was in, or maybe not the same. Unless the other flyable vehicles despawned on me. And other waypoints popped up, nope, you're not fooling me a second time! I did find an elevator that I had to shoot countless times to operate. Interesting. At the end of the elevator there was some corridors, one leading to an empty control room, another one leading to scanners that just went back and forth, this is where my journey ends as I got stuck in the wall, Fun fact:  Running for 8 seconds = 8km. Watch out, Usain Bolt! ~~~~~ Planet Zero Sandbox; You start inside a medium-sized spaceship that you can just leave the stupid planet with. But if you're curious (as I were) about the planet, here's a little something about the little planet called Zero; It looks like one of the random colourful planets from No Man's Sky. Except worse. Same trees over this part of the biome. Also present is a vehicle, a mecha that i FINALLY GOT TO CLIMB IN, a robot stucking, and a possible NPC that is void of life. Just like the rest of the game.  I did explore outside this colourful biome, and there was a vast desert. Until I hit the end of the planet, and started floating, oops. Fun fact: That planet is flat, guess the developer is a member of the flat earth society. ~~~~ Moon Sandbox; You guess it, the surface is just like the moon, except.. Probably not. It's a flat square. There's two robots walking back and forth, and the same lifeless NPC from Planet Zero, except he's floating this time. Moon gravity sure is weird. Two buildings nearby, with no doors, so no can explore. Same vehicles available as before, and a floating landing platform above the moon. I tried to approach the platform, but it kept floating away, until my spaceship did some barrel rolls, landed back on the moon head first, and I couldn't get out as I can't jump high enough, or climb. My God is this game annoying me. ~~~~ Vehicle Testing Sandbox; I'm invisible. The ground is pink. I see the vehicles. Been there, tried those. Nope. I'm done. ~~~~ TL:DR; It's not even worth the card drops. ",False,False

3506,"~Follow the link at the end for the full review~ Firstly, the writing is bad, bad, bad. I’m not sure if the writer is a non-native speaker, but the English often reads very awkwardly, with lots of strange turns of phrase, misused words, and grammatical errors. If you are writing fiction, you need to have a good enough command of the language you’re writing in to be able to convey what you want to say accurately – this wasn’t achieved here, and may have contributed to the other major issue I had, which was with the nonsensicality of the story as a whole. In short, the story is boring and pointless. I think the author was going for some kind of edgy, nihilistic vibe, but it just came off as clumsy and childish. The protagonist is instantly hate-able. I have no problem with this if that’s who the character is supposed to be – take Makoto in School Days, for example – but the characterization and message here was so confused. At times it felt like the author intended for us to sympathize with the protagonist, all while he continued to act like a vile, abusive garbage person. Stories that force you to empathize with a monster are interesting to me, but this wasn’t clever enough to fall into that category, and so we’re left with two characters we don’t care about, engaging in an un-enthralling sequence of distasteful interactions.

3531,"I was very much looking forward to the latest instalment in the series which is Total War Rome II. Sadly the game disappoints, this might be my own fault for not looking more closely to gameplay videos but mostly it is the developers. From the first game till Shogun Total War 2 the game just kept getting better, and that's because they kept just tweaking it a little. The graphics also kept increasing to further heights which made watchin the battles close-up immensly fun. Now to the harder part. I have to be honest and say I've only spent a few minutes in the game and even less in a battle, and the reason for this, is that the game infuriates me to such degrees that I couldnt keep playing. First off is the horrible, horrible UI, I've never been so annoyed in my life. The last games were easy to navigate and control. Everything from your armies to your cities. Suddenly instead of having an overview of the map the screen is just crammed with smaller windows with ugly pictures of your general and HUGE unit icons. Then theres the city management which they screwed up big time. Instead of having cities in provinces, you know have provinces with cities. This might sound like a good idea, but when your enemy or other AI, can have a few cities in the province, then you start becoming really confused. Furthermore the building options have been extremely limited of what I can see. Again, I have not played for very long, so it might get better later on, but still the UI is terrible, and in a game, where MANAGEMENT is a key gameplay element, you just can't have a  UI like the one in this game. Why couldnt you just have kept the simple nice UI from Shogun 2? Instead you fill up half the screen with crappy windows so I can't see the bloody map properly, and you can't even zoom out that far - How the  am I supposed to manage an empire like that?! Now that's out of the way, let's continue to the most disappointing feature in the game. The combat. Again it's the UI that lets the whole thing down. In Shogun 2 you had 3 simple features to look after. Minimap, Unit Management and Unit List. It was so nice and simple. In this Rome II abomination you have the same 3 features only they've scaled up the Unit List and and removed the unit management from the lefthand bottom corner to under the unit list. So you have this big mother  box filling up the screen where the fighting is happening. Then theres a useless picture of the general or whatever bastard you got controlled in the lefthand bottom corner. In the olden games, you atleast had the nice army control button. I remember them fondly from Shogun 2, so when you had your whole army selected you could move them forward, whilst they stayed in formation. Where are these controls now?! I couldnt find the bastard things and tried moving the whole army forwards, which resulted in just a long line of crap. The minimap they also placed down in the bottom line, just in the righthand corner. WHY DID YOU DO THIS? Now there's a huge line of windows in the bottom of your screen, which is also where all the fighting and unit movement goes on. Why not move some of does  windows up in the tophand corners in the sky. I'm interested in the  battle with swords and death and blood, not a load of UI windows! Furthermore that bloody unitlist and the new unit icons is bloody awful. It's the most simple thing I have ever seen, I can't understand they wanted to do the whole Roman/Greek culture with tile/marble kind of style, but the units look so bloody similar I cant see the difference between a general and a standard unit. Worst of all the unit-icons are so large, and you can't minimise the entire window, without being handicapped during the battle. This review isnt totally fair to the game, seeing as I've been playing it for a few minutes. You might actually like some of the changes, but if you are like me, and loved the previous games, and the feel of them - You're gonna be disappointed ",False,False

3540,"If you want to see it as a demo of a new horror game mechanism, Pineview Drive is great and could definitely be worth a try. If you're a veteran horror fan and will do anything for a few seconds of real in-game fear, I promise you that you'll get your scares in the first few hours--that alone might be worth the $15 price tag. But as a stand-alone game, judged against other indie horror games out there, Pineview Drive is probably not worth playing. The first few nail-biting days in the mansion had me really optimistic about what was coming next. But the tedious gameplay (plan to walk through pretty every room in the house, multiple times, every day, looking for keys or journal entries), the overused scares, and the lack of a compelling story quickly drained both fear and enjoyment from my experience. The developers themselves defend the lack of story, posting the following in the Steam forums: The problem with a philosophy like this is that it only makes sense if there is enough material in the game for the player to come up with their own version of events (think Home or even Gone Home). This haunted house has little personality of its own, and feels more like being in an amusement park ride than in an actual place with a history. For example, there was one random event that had my character trapped in a room full of clocks, and the ticking seemed to be driving him insane. All the clocks were set to 5:00. Did something happen at 5:00? Is that when I could have killed my wife, or when...something happened? No, it turns out that it was just another random scare, and the clocks were only set to 5:00 because that's where they stall at the end of each day. And I never did find out what my character had done or what happened to him. The events at the end of the game didn't reveal anything. For an example in contrast: in haunted-house games like Amnesia (both Frictional's original and thechineseroom's sequel), not only is there a coherent story, there are general themes that add to your experience of the environments. Exploitation, torture, loss of children, surveillance, monstrous industry...the simple events of the game are darkly colored by the way your imagination slowly mulls over these ideas as you play. You won't find any deep story elements like that in Pineview Drive. The scary sound is just a scary sound, the scary doll is just a scary doll, and you can be scared or not be scared in the moment--but this isn't a game where you take the fear with you, a game that leaves you lying awake at night, unable to move on to pleasant dreams. So much wasted potential in this game, which could have been something memorable with an overhaul of the key-hunting gameplay and some love from a writer who cares about telling a good story. I hope the developers learn from this experience and continue to work with their fear mechanic, because it does have a lot of potential. (However, it's also currently imbalanced, making the last day of the game almost impossible to complete.) ",False,False
3541,"Hello everyone, here's the story, I have 400 hours of work on Ark, I got it the day it was released and I'm going to start with ""I'm stopping Ark for good !!!"" The reasons given will not be on the players of Ark but only and solely on the development of the game ... 1- Since Wildcard released this game, it was very, very poorly optimized so they started to try to fill this huge flaw, not a long time but they tried ... 2-Despite the lack of optimization, Ark was filled with buggy dinos, buggy dino spwan and I remind you I always speak at the start! 3-There were connection bugs to official servers like the famous ""Snapshot16"" freeze after 30 min of loading so when you had it 5 times in a row you could count the time lost but I wouldn't let myself be taken down I tried all the same! 4-When you finally arrived to connect you were not safe from a savage crash, especially on unofficial ones caused by poor management of the host or admin abuse _______________ And that was just the problems of departure ! ____________________________________ Today ... 5-They have nerves of dinos or even weapons, etc ... and yet they keep adding content ... which is good ... then they bring it back! 6-Lots of content additions and very few bug fixes, very little optimization and too many updates that change the game to sabotage it or for nothing when it is not the additions of dinos that are going to make lag or see crash if you don't have a good pc and optimization is a request for many players but nothing ... very attentive to your community! 7-When I see the optimization wearing the console, more beautiful than average graphics than on a PC, on a console they remove some elements like decorations on the floors for example just to optimize so that it runs better (On the other hand, despite that, it is not worth that of pc for a lot of reasons, lack of mods, server Wednesday ... etc) whereas on pc they could have done it! It still shows Wildcard's will on the subject of ""OPTIMIZATION""! 8-Despite all the hours spent the pleasure and the rage of having played this game, I agree with the players who have emphasized it, the price is far too expensive today for a product that will be released and that is far from over, I have the impression that they are putting a lot of updates that do not serve much in the main except to break the game of those who play and who have a backup rollback of half an hour back (goodbye many dinos that I sifted), or spawn under the map, under foundations, or even flying fish, or dinos that you cannot even undermine because texture bugged on the ground, well in short it deserves to be in the guiness of the most buggy game records! 9-What are these abuses of SE dinos transfer on the island or the center? just on that ""no comments"" 10-The worst part in all this is that I only spoke relatively about what was wrong in this game without being able to say absolutely everything and just about the game because at the level players or even admins who abuse I will pass it because there is no need to say more ... Here are the 10 reasons I have to stop the costs with this game with great potential but in the dev downright wed ... k who sabotaged their own games while asking for more money from their players that they do not even respect, that they do not even listen ... We ask to stop adding buggy content or who break the little optimization brought to be able to correct them, we also wait for a promised story that will certainly never happen, we just miss something that could have been a crazy game but the players are gone, then the evaluations were ""very positive"" ""variable"", the notes speak for themselves and there will be only one step that this degrades ngole again and again because they have decided not to change their modes of playing their games ...

Doesn't help to get a better community, but it may help to at least make bullies and bad kids being together and people who are there to get fun together. So yeah, that'd require to rework matchmaking and stuff... -Being able to kick afk people who have put something on their mouse to spam left clic. And so a matchmaking during matches because when people leave or when you have afks in team... Well... You know that you cannot do a thing but try to kill people. Games with balls and such are not doable when you're the team down. -Season Pass progress through campaign... I dunno if I just didn't find the option, but when I enabled score or competitive score, it didn't progress the season pass, and that's annoying. I know it's mainly because Reach is my least favorite campaign, but it'd be great to progress through any kind of gameplay. -(from Hidden Xperia's videos) Getting off the controller's aim assist or having two different matchmakings with one enabled and one disabled. Or give mouse and keyboard aim assist too, LOL. (destroys the game for PC, can't make it with an aim assist, sadly). -(The one I'm not sure it's doable, but Halo would 500% get better with that) Custom crosshair. The one from the original game is so annoying because I love the cross or the dot... But this circle is just the worst crosshair I've ever experienced... How am I sure that with that circle I'm 100% on his head or am I praying gods that I'm high enough or centered enough... That's just a pain to play with this...

3557,"For my foreign friends: the story is dull and the protagonist is an idiot, the multiple choice are useless, the game is like in autopilot. This chapter is better than the first one (the new girl IMO is better than the other two, in a character development way), but it's not worth your money anyway. The drawings are the only thing that matter and that is well done, but it's not enough for buying the entire product. Sakura Beach 2 is an indie visual novel by Winged Cloud, famous for the Sakura series (self-financed and with the support of crowdfunding), composed of various titles of the genre with an erotic background. They are practically ecchi souls, without being souls. This is the continuation of a first chapter that I found unpleasant from various points of view: if you want to know more I have also reviewed that. I undoubtedly preferred this to the first, because they tried to solve the problems of the previous chapter even if they did not succeed completely. as always they are the focal point of the series, and of this Sakura too. Better cared for, less woody and with some more original touches than what was done with the first Sakura. the first was a papyrus of text with drawings inserted too fragmented. Here they are better positioned and feel less heaviness during the development of the novel. in my opinion a breath of fresh air and the most interesting and less stereotypical ... those two had tired. nothing exceptional but inserted with criteria. The bgm of the menu then remained particularly in my head. You can save and load saves at any time and it doesn't take too long to start (it's common for Sakura, but it's still useful if you want to read 5 minutes and close) very banal exactly like the previous chapter. The protagonist remains unbearable especially in refusing to do things that any man would have done in his place. His childhood friends remain particularly annoying in their saccenza but somehow less annoying than the first chapter. As aforementioned, the new girl is the antithesis of the two and in my opinion she made everything more bearable (shame about her not in-depth backstory that could lead to something interesting). Multiple endings that do not know of multiple endings, because they do not lead to any satisfying events and are beyond a purely graphic question and two lines of text, practically the same. However, I preferred them to the first one that didn't give a sense of closure at all. There remains the big defect of the first chapter of looking like a sort of ""power point presentation"". In the end there is certainly a choice, but for all the V.N. multiple choices are useless and especially when you would like to choose to do something you don't have the possibility to do it, and you are left to the protagonist's way of being that to say blind and stupid is to pay him a compliment. ten euros for a visual novel that you can finish in half an hour, with a poor script and that can easily be replaced by an anime / manga ecchi. Mmmmmm what do you think? Surely two euros during the sales is more than fair. Surely better made than the first part, but the novel remains boring. Useless dialogues already seen in ecchi of various types, unfortunately the insane component typical of ecchi is also reduced to the bone so it is not even funny. I felt a little curious in discovering some elements or resolutions of events in history but this curiosity was too sporadic. ""Mature"" ""and"" sexual content ""are not a little misleading since it has nothing sexual apart from the half-naked girls (and they remain half-naked) and let's forget about mature. the first chapter, or ""simulation""; since as mentioned above it is practically a power point presentation, I would say that they did well. I'm sorry in a way, because I've seen some improvements, but I don't recommend buying them. of a visual novel is the script, if that doesn't work even if the rest is discreet (or captivating in this case: P), in the end everything collapses like a house of cards. I can recommend it to someone who wants something. lightweight to pass the time or to some pre-teen first experience with an ecchi opera.If you are a Sakura fan, this is a byproduct and it's best to turn to others you haven't tried yet.

The physics are even worse, You can scale an almost 90 degree mountain with your bike at full speed no problem You can jump off the mountain with your bike no problem and as you land you continue in full speed The shooting was pretty good aswell as the stealth system, tho it could of been better if the A.I wasnt retarded The game itself is very very repedetive. Go there. Kill the bad guys.

Then play No Man's Sky, a universe which may have almost unimaginable breadth, but the depth of a broken sink you might find in the alleyway behind your nan's house.  I had the pleasure of visiting Minnesota once - after I left the Twin Cities I was fascinated to see how sparsely populated the rest of the state was, driving for hours between tiny towns.  After playing No Man's Sky, which doesn't a single city in an entire Universe, I suddenly felt that even Minnesota might be overcrowded! Play for under 2 hours, marvel at what you see - for you can see much of what the game has to offer, then decide whether you might be better off refunding this and buying something completely different but considerably more entertaining like Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Far Cry 5 or any other AAA title that takes your fancy - why not, that's the beauty of Steam and the bemusement that nearly two years after its disastrous launch NMS is still the same price.  Fair play to Hello Games, they have added such wondrous content as ""freighters"" - manned by little aliens no less! And there's even some combat (alas X-Wing vs TIE Fighter it is not), and crafting / building - after all in an 'infinite universe which is supposed to be explored why wouldn't you want to build a house on a planet you'll probably never return to! In a game with crafting, exploring, dog-fighting, and trading (well technically), it's a damning indictment that after a few hours the most fun you'll be having is naming the cookie-cutter flora and fauna on the latest cookie-cutter planet you're visiting.  I recommend picking something offensive, not obviously so that it gets filtered out automatically, or cried about too! TL:DR If you're feeling particularly flush and in a mood to see what all the fuss is, buy it and play for 1 hour 59 minutes and refund, then feel smug that you didn't pay full price on launch day and that you can pick up something (or things) fun for the same price.

3642,"Square Enix is once again betraying the trust of their costumers with the cancelation of 3 major Episodes, leaving this game permanantly incomplete. Rather than fixing the Story of this game they are busy making useless content and marketing their merchs. Tabatas resignation also showed how lazy and disorganized the developers really are. I bought this game in hopes of betterment but SE screwed it up once again. They had 10 years of developement and all we got was a half complete game.  The world is big and the graphics are impressive but there is really little to do especially in endgame. 2/3 of the Map is not accessible, SE was probably too lazy to fill the rest of the maps with details and decided to put an invisible wall behind it. And the story is clearly rushed and the episodes do little to improve it except episode ignis. I dont care what diehard FF fans say or the naive love they show for this game but FFXV is and will always remain SEs biggest failure. SquareEnix is just as bad as EA, Capcom, Konami, Microsoft, etc. Microtransactions, releasing unfinished games, DLC nickel and diming, franchise whoring, development hell, and then writing off franchises because they failed due to their own actions. People love to bash Activision/Blizzard and EA for doing these things, but when SquareEnix does it, they look the other way (outside say Mankind Divided). See FFXV, an overpraised unfinished pile of mediocrity. Instead of grilling the company for releasing an outdated design of a game that is clearly unfinished, it gets praised for returning the franchise to form (Really, name one mainline FF game that is as unpolished and incomplete as FFXV, you really can't). SquareEnix's actions have clearly weakened Mankind Divided, and has hurt the Deus Ex franchise. And do not get me started on their mobile games, most of them are cash grab for those who eat member berries. And in regards to DLC, they are even worse than EA as SquareEnix rips you off with small short DLC for bigger prices. See Rise of the Tomb Raider or Mankind Divided. At least EA DLC many times have substance behind them. They have the worst Season Passes in gaming by far. And them looking at episodic games is just going to end in disaster, with them failing to understand how it works or even how Life is Strange succeeded (okay, they made a great move publishing that game and allowed DONTNOD to go with their vision, but really, EA would have let them do the same thing here). How far they have fallen from their Squaresoft days, when they were a highly touted developer who almost always delivered quality, and when they failed, its because the idea didn't really work instead of them screwing themselves.

3692,"I played the game for 6 hours, but it is worth noting that I am not a master bannerlord player or a heavy follower, which I will not fail to say just because of the Turkish game. The missing aspects: - The graphics have remained very simple in 8 years (like Skyrim and the production of 2011) at least one kingdom could come, but I don't mind that much. - The mechanics are very prosaic, I do not expect one for honor or heavy mechanics, but I think our character is too cumbersome and the issue of blocking can be made easier and palpable. -Fps instant drops, problems such as freezing on the loading screen are a bit intimidating that they cannot be solved in 8 years, but I do not say much about ""early access"", but it would not be bad if it is resolved. - No matter how hard you try to create a character, you cannot come up with a beautiful face or character, I think it should be paid attention. - Our conversations with npc are very incomplete, I don't know if this is because of the translation, but it feels like it's talking to the robot. - I cannot say that they are very good at artificial intelligence, unfortunately, I hope they fix it. The + sides are as follows: - First of all, it is a Turkish game and it sounds good to be recognized in such a proud sector. - In-game music is very relaxing and made with very nice in mind. - The interface is clearer and more stylish than other strategy games. -I can't say perfect as a game, but it's fine compared to other strategy games. -The developments in the game, the way we tell the story and other details are really nice.

Might be worth trying once it is out of early access (in like another 3 years or so right??) but for now it doesn't even seem worth it to me, even with it being f2p.

3715,"As VNs go, this one struck me as a bit... miserable. Setting the scene: a boy is living a pretty dull life, worried about his weak sister, almost always hospitalised, not particularly serious about his schooling, and cooking and looking after relatives with unusual working hours. He gets dragged to a dinner by his childhood friend, Ai, doesn't realise the time so ends up rushing to try to catch the last train. Before you know it they get transported to another world. I only went the one romance route - with Ai, as it seemed the most natural. My experience did not want me to play the others, so I cannot speak for them, but some of the themes that crop up can be a bit disgusting. I suppose it's only natural to expect this type of thing from VNs these days, but I find myself asking if it's really necessary. The first problem is the 'sis-con' theme. Is it just commonplace in Japanese culture or are there just more weirdos than I realise in the world? I have a sister in real life and every time I read some rubbish in VNs about the protagonist or his friends teasing him about 'sis-con' it turns my stomach. It's utterly gross! Including this type of content in a story does nothing to make me like it or enjoy it more. Even when your supposed 'older' sister asks you to have a bath together and the guy eventually agrees in a room full of people... ok, yeah, because that is normal. /endsarcasm Not just that, but the protagonist is stupid. There is no other word for it. I'm no expert on relationships - I've been single all my life - but following the path of Ai, there are so many hints dropped in his face, and he never gets it. It's painful to read how stupid he is. When a girl has to scream in your face 'I love you!' and you're still clueless, you lose all hope for good storytelling. Good storytelling is being able to suspend the reader's disbelief - no way is it believable someone could be this dense. If I were lucky enough to have a girl childhood friend this long, and one that would deliberately fail tests just to go to the same not-as-good uni as me, I think I'd sit up and pay attention. I'm impressed there is voiced characters, but the art is pretty tame - especially backgrounds - and the gallery unlocks don't seem to be anything special either. The 'regular world' backgrounds are like looking through a car window getting rained on too - if it weren't for the characters themselves I swear I'd think I was going blind. So I came up with my own ending, I like my version better. I spoiler tag it because by you knowing this isn't what happens, you can infer what does happen:- ",False,False

Edit I'd like to actually say that I loved the first fnaf game, the creepiness, the originality of the game. I had been a fan before it was on steam greenlight, I downloaded the demo and thought the game was pretty cool, and bought it once it was out on steam. Oh yay! A second game came out. Oh. Scott just made it harder and added more animatronics, well you can't always expect the most out of sequels, especially how fast it was made, I appreciate the storyline and gameplay. A... Third one? Horror attraction? Okay, this looks really cool. The third game was my favorite, between the hallucinations and minigames and wrapping the story up, I enjoyed it a lot. Well I liked the fnaf series, a good storyline and a- Wait... a.... fourth... game?....? ???? Okay. More explanation to the story, I liked when it all had more mystery to it but, I really really hope this is the last one.  I loved the creepy atmosphere and paranoia of the fnaf games, how fnaf 2 could look happy and cheery but then those eyes in the vents, withering your patience away. I loved freddy's lullaby playing in the first game, with the power out with you sitting there just hoping you can make it till 6 am, hell I even bought the mobile versions because I liked it so much. Fnaf world. I was so upset when I heard about this. Scott should have stopped at 3, but instead he wanted to cater to the fandom of children who made these characters cute and wanted an easy game to play, he ruined the entire original idea of the game just for money, it makes me so sad to see an artists creation get stomped all over for money and to give the majority of the fandom some stupid fanservice.

Perhaps once it didn’t otavllo, but she otavlett, and even very much. I probably runes. The maximal ones are thirteenth. When I found out about that, it shocked me. And that they are about 300k rubles. 300k ... and then only runes. in addition to runes, there is also gear, which plays a huge role in any MMORPG. And as in any MMORPG, that gear has different qualities. I won't touch the white one, I'll just take the green one. Green-blue-violet-red-scarlet-nova scarlet. I do not know how it is, but it was exactly like that on 4.0. To craft gear (and there are more than fifteen clothes), you will also come to invest a lot of money or farm sweaty and very rattling. In addition to gear, there are stones (amotsvet). Another plug. Stones give tats, and they give quite well. The quality is the same as the gear. starts with green, ends with alat. These stones will be put into clothes, 3 pieces per item, which also takes a lot of money or long and hard work. Okay, I'll forget about that. Now for the buns. achnu caskets. They are, as long as I remember, 30 Cree apiece. And in order to knock out something useful from there, you will come to spend at least 500 rubles. There may be at least something and drop out. I don’t know how much you need to spend to knock out the top bun. It's scary to imagine. Further. Mounts in L. Too expensive. Even the same horse that gives 35% to the shortage ... in most MMORPGs it is given free of charge, and here you pay 100 rubles (before, it was 200 in general). From this the point is zero. It also calls for about 3 seconds. They also introduced assault armor. why, gopodi, why ?! And without her it played perfectly. I left the game two years ago when 5.0 was released. I had a bow with 6 runes, red gear and 60 lvl. It is unbearable to play talo further. First, the graphics are very beautiful. Vyo is very pleasing to the eye. Even atral travelers look very efficient and beautiful. PvP isn't sick here either. Best milestone I've seen. The tmofer in the game is perfect. The characters are also on top.

3734,"I moderately liked it during the time, the previous project of the same ipants, but that was in 2014, and since then there have been only new games that have gone far ahead in all parameters - games that not only look great and sound great, but also tremendously entertain you on every game tap, and they will pay great attention to the elaboration of the heroes, the development of the south, the correct presentation of dialogues and the comfort of the player, which is very, very tedious to return back to the container school. Ghost 1.0 hasn't gone very far from Unepic, either externally or internally. In general, there was only enough men for two hours (to drag to the first boa through monotonous rooms, which also required to run back and forth several times). How to spend 30 (or even 60 hours) here, as the game requires, I can't imagine. I liked a lot only branded author's dialogues with jokes about them on the vete. The voice acting is ottoyna, the southern part didn’t rattle a gram in the first two hours, the gameplay was mediocre (the control was tolerable, but it was better; the function of controlling the enemy robots was zanting only the first couple of times; the arena rooms are crazy random flashing; the upgrades are ordinary; the item of secrets causes very a lot of questions, especially if you are impatient with perfectionism). An extremely tedious owl-item of security at fixed checkpoints, which are met once in five large rooms. The game does not try to crush with hardcore, like a true owls (except that the boys are false), but you can die with meta proprietary (and lose all your current money), and the lack of regenerating drops only forces you to run until the checkpoint - to specially return to it in order to protect (and heal ), and then drag your feet back to the next room. Many people in games like different things, but surely fans will find a similar bustle running around in the heat of the day. There is also something wrong with the video mode: for the first time on my memory, the game does not have Vsync in the settings, and the crane twitches noticeably when moving (i.e., by the way). Plus, it’s very small, and for two hours of playing, I even started to ache in my head (I forced Vsync in the video drivers, but it didn’t change anything else - perhaps it was necessary to restart the game).

3745,"While I would love to give this game a good review, in it's current state I just can't and this is because of a large amount of reasons, none of them small.  For starters, let's get some of the pros of this come out of the way. For one, this game has some greatly satisfying and repeatable gameplay to it. I'm not sure what it is, but the overall gameplay just doesn't get boring even if you don't win. Then theres the monetization, while i'm not one to keen on the whole idea of monetization in payed games, this game does it the right way to where it isn't egregious in the slightest. All outfits can be earned with currency, and the best outfits are bought ""crowns"" this is a currency earned by purely winning a game. Hell, even the ""battlepass"" which is something I despise is completely free. Now, while this game has some strong aspects going for it, it is not in a state I can recommend by any means. The biggest issue by far as of right now is the ridiculous amount of cheaters. It's gotten so bad to the point where you can't go 2 rounds without encountering someone zipping about in the air or speed hacking. Even the response given to this is awful, the team encourages people to not report cheaters and instead refrain from sharing videos of them to discourage more cheating. This is single handedly the worst response to a cheating issue i think i've seen to date. This reason in it of itself is enough for me to dislike the game, but i prefer to list all the cons and pros of a game to get the full picture. Now, the bugs in this game are very annoying. For starters, player physics are completely tied to FPS. What does this mean? Well, this means that if your FPS is to low you'll fall on your butt like a disabled kid without his crutches. On the other end of the spectrum, to high FPS and you'll be slip and sliding around like you're running on a tarp after a lesbian orgy was had on it. 60fps is the default cap, and the only way to disable this is by turning VSYNC off which actually turns it on or by using nvidia control panel. Though, unless you enjoy falling flat on your face all the time this is highly discouraged. And then we have the near CONSTANT soft locks of this game, you'll be hard pressed to not find yourself needing to task manager close the game with the amount of times you'll be soft locked. On the bright side, this soft lock only happens when you are already dead, but what this lock is, is when you are unable to open the esc menu in order to leave the game. In all honesty though, my biggest issue is the sheer lack of content. Theres 25 minigames, which sounds like a decent number right? Except the way the game is structured, you'll see the same ones over and over again, and they only show up on certain rounds leading up to the small 4 finals. By the time that season 2 drops at the time of writing this, we will be 2 months without a single new minigame which is just unacceptable.  All in all, this game has a huge amount of potential but I don't see it surviving past november with how the devs are handling this game. There are many issues, and none of them small. Once season 2 drops, I'll come back to this review and update it on how the game is then but I still don't have high hopes. ",False,False

3779,"I didn’t expect Lust from Beyond to receive a second prologue (hell, I don’t think I’ve ever seen any developer promoting their final product this way), but here we are: it’s hard for me to walk past free first-person horror-anything so it was only a matter of seconds to make up my mind, especially after the first prologue leaving a positive impression on me. Scarlet might have retained a large portion of pros and cons from the previous game, but it also introduces mechanics I’m not entirely sure the final version will improve upon, given how close we are nearing its release. More on that below… The player assumes the role of Alan, some nutjob with a rather concerning, ahem, “masturbation-frequency-cycle . Now I don’t know how he brought the news to his friend, but either way he assisted him in getting hooked up with a girl online, with their meeting point being a busted up and abandoned theater: it does raise suspicion in Alan after entering the building and observing his environment, but he decides he’s already far too deep to quit and I’m definitely not referring to his date. The ominous setup should have been enough for anyone to nope out in 2 seconds flat, but not for Alan: after all, this is just making everything kinkier, it’s all part of the show right? Coming across a piece of paper basically telling him “you aren’t the first idiot to fall for it, it’s already too late: Alan is being held in captivity by cultists forcing him to work through “trials allowing him to travel the slimy, disgusting halls of Lusst’ghaa. Eventually, the portals to the World of Horny play into his advantage and he attempts to escape, only to end up in the seat of a therapist who is just as invested in the whole lust-themed matter. With that being said, Alan jumps from one frying pan into another and his fate seems to be sealed, but the ending screen implies otherwise.  Once again, it’s a simple game of walking, exploring, reading and watching: the graphics are almost up to scratch, really love the emphasis on red colors / lights and I myself prefer an abandoned theater as the main location over the Victorian mansion. The sound design is not deserving of high praise, but gets the job done in setting the mood. I can’t say I found the voice acting awful, the cultists may be overdoing it with the edginess but the phone conversations seem accurate, at least if it’s someone with a chronic masturbation problem desperately trying to score. The most glaring and off-putting flaws are definitely in the short stealth and fighting segments: there is no point in hiding if you can outrun the AI so easily and if the game warns you of utilizing combat as the last resort, it’s essentially another way of saying “our combat blows so please don’t use it as much, because that is what it does. I didn’t mind the lack of an FOV slider (again) until experiencing those visual effects of taken damage and lost sanity, the image zooms in so hard I could throw up. The movement still feels jittery, a complaint I voiced in the first 2 games as well: 60FPS don’t feel like 60FPS, it’s an atmosphere killer and none of the video settings can fix it. And don’t even get me started on the plain obvious puzzle solutions, it’s as if the developers think we shouldn’t rely on using our brains a little and should instead maintain full focus on the shock values of sexual torture and…. scat? To each his own.  Scarlet is a clearly the more inferior segment out of the two, but the potential is undeniably there. Although the content I’ve seen here lessened my interest in purchasing Lust from Beyond on release (I rarely do that, anyway), I’m still curious as to what else the lore surrounding the world of Lusst’ghaa has got in store for us.

3802,"The visual art is outworldly, it is the sophistication of all the great names from the past and the present on the darkest of the art-designs and whoever is the artists behind all that, were really inspired by the devil himself. Of course Giger's plagiarism may be around but nothing so blatant... except for the Charon train, and the beasts in the end somewhat. That was half way blatant.  Music/ambience is fine, it helps trigger the spiritual decline for each room, it isn't always that special but mostly fitting, specially after escaping the castle. The only immature music is the staff roll that doesn't fit the theme. Art isn't just static in there, its also a bit animated. Speaking of which, art seems to be a spawn out of Zebu's nightmare after a bad day on the Erebus. It isn't always striking but definitely disturbing. I wish I could pay someone to model embossed figures on my wall with one of those arts, so now you see how much I love it.    But when it comes to the story itself and the dialog in-game, Tormentum falls flat. Insane characters speaks to you like a guy writing the script on his confy room, the lack of voice acting helps it to be even more noticeable. It seems you can have a good or bad ending or whatever, because there are some little choices to make, but it was so immature it broke the thing for me. Programming on that regard was just minimalist, unsatisfying, weird balancing to define what ending you deserve. The story progress is so uninteresting I was only playing it to see the screens, not because I wanted to know what would happen. Plot isn't dark enough, there is nothing horrific and it barely motivates me. It's just another monolithic belief that labels sex or women as an force of descent or the actual cause of it. Two faces one coin, yadda yadda, whatever is it got nothing on me either way. There are two types of puzzle category in this game and both are rather annoying. Puzzles are as easy to do as they are confusing, people tend to think that's what constitutes it to be. Very few of them on Tormentum are intuitive by their own. The first type is ''look for things and see if it fits'' and the second type is just a sequential unlocking method. Sometimes is a trial and error thing, sometimes its straight given away. Since Shadow Gates, it seems the cheapest of it has always to be ''play the hard music in the end'' kinda puzzle.  Somehow I think they went on the wrong direction, maybe the devs should have tried an RPG or something. You can't even die, you're only barricated behind annoyingly easy stuff each step of the way. You don't fear failure because there's none (only if you consider the ending). The game sole existence seems to be like a album stock. Only two puzzles had some entertaining difficulty, that isn't saying much. The springs (a classic tower-like stacking) and a cheap TV memory game inside a cube. Many of such solutions are out of guess-how instead of anything else smart. With that said, when a puzzle is ''hard'' it is just because you're absolutely clueless given the condition, not because it is complex or well hidden. The old days of point-clicking games, Myst had some sort of refined exploration for hidden secrets. Well Tormentum wastes a lot of nice backgrounds that could have been encrypted to inspire you to work on puzzles, I only remember seeing two silly attempts. The train code and the musical instrument... Tormentum is filled with gorgeous, yet empty signs that mostly leads you to dumbness. The ones that ""may"" matter, are wrote down by the character himself so you can check on the book later... *sigh* The overall is insufficient for me to review this positively   I would feel bad forever to just thumb this thing down, all due the artwork, music and imagery alone. I don't like that method of luring me to buy it though. The lack of neutral scores is another reason I can't thumb this up. I still wouldn't pay to have such a game (if that's even a game) I would rather pay for Tormentum's artwork alone without the game. You do get some bonus artwork in the end  . Unless you can have a discount or if the price on your country is low, I totally discourage you from buying it as for now. Final score: 4/10.  What should be really motivating is the sets of backgrounds and every one of the emojis, if it wasn't for them prices, because they are beautiful   Some cards looks really good while others are mild, either way they are not cheap.

3880,"to me is like the otome version of EA, it promises a lot, but never fully delivers; the only difference is, instead of being riddled with bugs, these games are riddled with grammatical errors and such.    Having previously played   (and many of the other games by Winter Wolves), which is set in the same universe and shares the same rpg/vn style gameplay, I thought I knew what I was getting myself into, however, where Loren shone a little brighter,   didn’t quite reach the mark.   The first noticeable difference between the two games is at the start you are able to customise your MC’s appearance. I was quite excited about this as the former game only allowed you to choose a gender. I quickly realised I was in for a disappointment when my MC wasn’t allowed any face time. Now, I know it’s not unusual in visual novels for the character you are playing to not always show up on screen but in this case, the appearance customisation is completely pointless. The only time you see the fruits of your labour are during battles in the form of a candid face shot and the attribute menu – Both of these could have been a staple image; the reason why that would have been better? Well, that moves me swiftly on to the cg’s - They are literally pin-ups. If you had hoped to see your character making out with the LI’s in all sorts of positions like in Loren, once again expected to be sorely disappointed! Because of Winter wolves choosing pin-up images instead, all feelings of romance go out the window leaving you with a terrible PG13 version of smut.   I know it might seem harsh of me to compare the two games when it is completely possible to play Cursed Lands without having played Loren (you just won't notice/understand all the references) but that is sadly the fate of games in a series.   The overall story feels bland. Uninteresting companions that you just aren't able to bond with.   Conversations are always one on one – doesn't provide the team building I liked in Loren.   So much filler and lots of days need to be skipped because there’s nothing to do except arena which is highly boring and repetitive.  Expect condescending and pointless drivel in the form of such things as being told the very basics of what trading is for a good 5 minutes (especially   if you pick a merchant background at the start), the qualities of trust and how an adult woman doesn’t even know she feels trust towards another, how different temperatures and humidity can drastically change how well bread is baked and my personal favourite, how your assassin companion, who you knew was an assassin before you even met him is indeed an actual assassin that does assassinations. These are just a few examples.   If you even manage to get far enough in to this game to pick a LI, don’t even start raising your hopes for something good. You will only be graced with three very short meetings (technically two meetings and a dream about them) with your chosen lover that amount to nothing but reading how they and the MC probably just screwed for a while. That’s it – your character has begun a sexual relationship. No real   bonding, no steamy scenes –    And what of your other companions while you are off having these relations? No clue. There is barely any interaction with them anymore and once you have done your three   scenes, you don’t even get to meet with anyone any more apart from two pointless character’s that turned up just to add more filler.   The ending is the absolute best. Upon finally getting to and defeating the   you are suddenly hit with a watered down 10-minute story of why this   did what he did. I literally just sat there, completely unimpressed by the totally cliché reason and wondered why, instead of all that pointless chat I went through during the game, couldn’t they have put hints and such about this guy's character out in the world. I felt as if there was zero effort put in to the plot at all.   It looks like if you don’t advance the quest for the ‘Tomb of Urd’ after the second full moon but before talking to the dunemarchers, the option to do so vanishes and does not return until a while later and can be easily missed again – This is also tied to an achievement which is annoying if you are an achievement hunter!   The art work is nice I guess – especially the backgrounds. Characters sometimes have rather creepy expressions but the pouting it kinda cute.    I’d highly suggest this novel have a proof reader go through and correct the numerous problems but seeing as it was released in 2018 I don’t think Winter Wolves cares. ",False,False
3881,"I'm not really a fan or a hater of games about Stalker, and indeed all of that ""zone"" theme, but besides, Metro is not a big fan of me (and Shadow of Chernobyl is not bad either). about here suddenly a multiplayer shooter with anomalies, talker atmosphere and so on. Sounds cool, doesn't it? about here a complete foul. And fart Gopod saved me from the bullying of the very early dothup like the initial betatet, since I didn’t even follow the game, but the way the Steam title page beckoned me with a banner, and the warm impressions of the first games of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Metro even more taunting men to try out the new game that ordered.

Nobody crushed the tmofers here either, the peronazh is wadded, not able to climb or crawl. nomalia, too, for no reason, went into one and immediately died. I understand that there are people who twiddle around Stalker and have gone through all the fashions that they write for him. Therefore, they hawala even that shit. but there is not even a hint that that game will be successful, here you need to redo it.

Stop dishonouring yourself, id, and either completely remove the abilities, or make a playlist w/out them, or else remove the word 'Quake' from the title. Because this is NOT a Quake game! You can't just put visuals & aesthetics that belong to the franchise and are easy to identify, place Cthulhu statues here and there, and make other cosmetic changes, and then BAM, call it a 'Quake' game. Quake had always revolved around skill-based gameplay. There's NO such a thing in a game with all these imbalanced and totally unfair abilities. Again, defensive use of them is probably fine (but if you ask me I would make devs remove passive/defensive stuff altogether, too), but even this should be much more limited. And don't get me started on the 'offensive part of the equation'. There's cheese all over the place. UPD 19/12/2018: Nope, uh-uh, still won't recommend this piece of . 'Classic' game mode or not, it still is just a sideways-mode that average player won't bother looking for, thus QC remains a shameful ability-based fest that it always was. Next. Net issues, lags and high ping bs. The absence of a primitive server browser is palpable. Hit registrations sucks balls, especially when a rocket that had been shot before player's death won't cause any damage (direct hits included!) to the player who gunned him/her down. 'From the grave' medals, anyone? Nope? That's what I thought.

YEAH! #PutsOnGlasses Just like in ordinary PvP matches, bots are either super-noobs aka 'shooting mannequins' standing still all the time, or they're both super-aggressive and pinpoint accurate. Waaay to go, dev team! Way to go! I  applaud to you, no seriously, it takes a great skill to ruin The Quake multiplayer experience. I consider myself a veteran having played Q3 from year 1 (although w/out Internet as every other kid in early 2000s), QLIVE multiplayer (for 600+ hrs) and now more than 100 hrs playing THIS - I think I actually can express my displeasure with what you've done to one of my favorite multiplayer games of all time. I'll be brief: you  ruined it. I'm just genuinely shocked seeing how there are so many people actually enjoying this game. Like, wow, this is unbelievable how those can play this piece of code w/out a second thought or a sour taste in their mouths. I guess you hit the right target demographics out there, congrats! Except there's nothing 'Quake' about it. You can mimic the movement, add the same looking levels, chars, weapons and all the stuff. You can even get the LG feel right! But this just won't work.

Well, where do I start? First off, I cannot for the life of me start this game up by conventional means without it crashing instantly, and trust me, I'm not the only one experiencing similar problems, browse it on the internet if you must.  ...but of course, such could be fixed easily, just give the game a try in ""compatibility mode"", and you should be good to go right? Wrong! Running this bastar in compatibility mode for ""Windows XP Service Pack 3"" (the recommended) or even going as far as adventuring your self in the ancient ruins of ""Windows 95"" will in fact boot you up past the start up screen, but good luck playing the game for about 10 or so minutes without it freezing dead on its tracks! On top of it by running it in compatibility mode you can kiss your steam overlay tab good bye. I didn't gave up though, upon some research, I discovered that many other things could cause the game to crash such as programs related to your Webcam, which you obviously shouldn't bother with if you don't have one, that is unless you happen to have ""Dxtory"" (which is kindda like good old ""Fraps"") installed, as for some odd reason ""Dxtory"" appears as a Webcam, and yes even if it's turned off it'll affect the game (I heard ""XSplit"" might cause the same symptoms as ""Dxtory"", but I'm not sure), uninstall it and see if it does the trick. ...but it could maybe even be related to your multi-core CPU, which if so, it could supposedly be fixed by doing as it follows... - Right Click ""Burnout Paradise"" > Properties > Set Launch Options > (type in) -multithread (and press OK). Of course, such didn't work for me either and sadly, as of now, I can only play the game 10 minutes at a time, on top of that, the game does not support classic ""Window Mode"", which might not seem like a big deal, but sometimes you might need to do such because reasons...

3916,"Requested refund. For $10 i expected a lot more. Just not sure how this is a finished product. I had this game wishlisted and was very excited to see more reviews and improvements. But after the news they were removing due to receiving more reviews than activation's ?? So I pulled the trigger even though I was on the fence based off the 2 reviews I could see for the price.   I tried to be patient with it but ultimately its not very nice experience. I often glitched into the world where objects disappear leaving open white space due to what seems going out of boundaries. Then had to reload a save point because I was stuck inside a rock, a tree, the ground ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Sometimes I could jump frantically toward the path and make it out.  The controls and dialogue seemed slow in responsiveness. There are a lot of delays both when moving and choosing dialogue that don't seem to make sense for the game. Meaning, doesn't seem like it should be part of the experience. You also have to left click your text option, or the arrow to acknowledge it and progress. So with 4 monitors my mouse cursor  moving outside of the game window was troublesome, and broke any immersion I managed to build up.  Graphically there are parts so dark and blurry that its frustrating at best to try and navigate. Primarily at the start of the game but also night in the woods.  The start was a complete nightmare to navigate. First several times I tried it seemed there were no options except wait and then run, hurry!! It was like blackness and blurs with blinding snowflakes. Trying to determine where the smoke was to follow, or even where the trees stopped was impossible. You can't run through the trees and you can get stuck on them so a lot of, 'hey you were caught'...again! Then the falling snowflakes were blinding in addition to the screen blurs that were happening when panning around this dark mess.  After 40 minutes or so of this looping madness I was just standing there and went to esc the game, but hey! yes controls do exist! The delay of dialogue at the start was just THAT slow when you initially start. So by reducing a few of the options I could actually see there was snow and trees not to run into, as well as the smoke you are meant to follow.  I wouldn't mind giving to this/these developers if it were $3 or less. But doesn't make sense to me to pay $10 for this experience although s/he will make some bank taking advantage of removed game collectors to say the least. ",False,False

I'll admit I was a bit rusty at the beginning--almost everyone would, unless they were grinding the base game all this time for God knows what reason--, so take my complaints with a grain of ""just git gud lmao"" The main problems stem from the fact id has either forgotten how to design good arenas or the DLC not having been developed by the main team. I can't find a good reason how could they think ""Hey, let's drop an archvile, three carcasses, a couple of mancubi and some other  inside a narrow corridor"" and come to a conclusion that is a good idea. But I wish that was the main problem. There is also a matter of horrendously long fights, think 10 minutes long or shorter/longer depending on how good you're at focusing down targets that progress the fight. It wouldn't have probably been such a problem had the arenas not been so small. I can't tell you the exact number of times I made a wrong turn inside an arena and stumbled on 5 or so stacked demons who not only bodyblock you, but were also bodyblocking themselves from reaching you. The arenas in the first two levels (barring a couple of exceptions) are just not designed to accomodate large numbers of demons, but designers still say  it and have you deal with them. I can only really commend the last level, it had WELL DESIGNED fights, large enough arenas and mostly felt like a level from the base campaign. The music is bland, which was to be expected after Gordon's departure. Once again, I really want to say I liked it, but the tracks were so forgetable, I can barely remember a single one and the one I do remember is ambient. Oh, did I say each level has only 1 combat track and it just plays on loop the entire time? Good stuff. I'm not sure how much time did Levy and Hulshult have, so it could be a time issue, but I still feel like had Gordon still been around, he would've written more than than, not even mentioning the quality of his work. The story, ignoring the fact they continue butchering 2016's lore, is reaching cringe levels that should not be possible. Whoever thought that adding a geeky nerd as a medium between the doomguy's inner thoughts and the player is clearly insane. When you had Hayden/VEGA tell you to do stuff, it made much more sense than when some INTERN says stuff out loud that is obvious even without him saying it. The best example was when Hayden transfers himself into Seraph--you clearly understand that Hayden is Seraph--and the first thing you hear in the next cutscene is ""HEY DID YOU KNOW HAYDEN IS A SERAPH, HE'S BEEN WITH US THE ENTIRE TIME"". No , dude. My expectations for part 2 are even lower than they were for part 1. I can only hope they'll do something about the combat loop. They nailed it perfectly in the base game and here combat just didn't feel fun until I reached the last level. ",False,False

The graphics are much better than the original games Counter Strike Source and Counter Strike 1.6 and there are numerous maps so one does not get bored of the existing maps (not that you'll be paying anything other that Dust II anyway). The community as I said earlier is not the friendliest. My first online match in the game was Casual match on a map of the current mission, Operation Wildfire where I joined roughly in the third round. However before I even fired a single shot I was kicked from the map for simply joining.

3941,"This piece of particular DLC needs no introduction. With that in mind, let's take a look at it's contents and see if they're worth the seven dollars asking price. Firstly, we're going to take a look at the survivor,  , as well as his perks, starting with.. Whenever you are unhooked, aura of the killer will be shown to you for a number of seconds (from a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 6 depending on perk level) and the hook will instantly break, rendering it unusable for the next 180 seconds. This perk allows you to see the aura of survivors who unhooked you/you unhooked or you healed/who healed you, while also allowing those survivors to see your aura. The amount of survivors whose aura you can see/who can see your aura can be increased with perk level. At the beginning of a match, you start with three tokens. Whenever the killer sees your aura, a token is consumed and the perk is activated. After the latter, your aura and scratch marks will not be shown to the killer for a number of seconds (from 6 to 10 seconds depending on perk level). Now that we've been through Jeff's perks, let's take a look at the other side of the coin, that being  His power is called   and it allows him to run at an increased movement speed, put survivors in the   status effect and vault pallets. With the killer's power out of the way, only the perks remain, with the first one being.. Hitting a survivor while carrying another will pause the wiggle timer (from 2 to 4 seconds depending on perk level) while receiving no cooldown on missed swings. Whenever survivors exit a locker, they suffer from the Exposed status effect for 15 seconds. You can also open lockers 30 to 50% faster depending on perk level. The aura of a generator will be shown to the killer for a number of seconds (from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 12) whenever two or more survivors are working on it. While the survivor is at least decent, the same cannot be said about the killer. It's been nerfed, buffed and tweaked a thousand different ways and now it's just there for whoever wants to play him.

3962,"This game was pretty fun to start off with when me and friends were playing it together, first coop, then trying PVP multiplayer. It is is a pretty grindy game by default, but the   pitfall came with the crappy base system. So first base that I set up in a PVP server, got it pretty beefy, and a nude guy puts sleeping bags outside the base and literally starts wacking away at the base walls with a basic low-end tool, and chips away at the big hp, slowly but surely. It forced me to stay in the base, and if I attempted to leave and kill him, which was risky at times, he would just respawn, build a new pickaxe from lying around materials, then start chipping damage on a wall again. The most annoying  on the mic you could imagine, as he was wacking away taking his sweet time. Yeah there is absolutely no point in making bases in PVP if the cheapest tool can destroy the strongest armor. Added with the grind factor, that kills the multiplayer aspect of this game, aside from coop. You wouldn't like this game singleplayer ether with how this game is.

XP now, really? Gee I didn't know I bought this just to compete on who can stab who better with more FASHIONABLE FINESSE, as if I care. Let alone ""level up"" for anything.

4024,"First off, I'm not gonna be like these other reviewers downvoting instead of not recommending because of a problem they had with Uplay. I've played the game and finished it, and put alot of time into this game, therefore I am actually gonna talk about the game, and discussing about what Ubisoft did right and wrong. It's definetly the most unique Assassin's Creed game out there. It shares a few elements from the other ones, but makes its own mark with its setting... 18th century Carribean. The gameplay is incredibly easy. All the enemy types are the same, and even though the animations are well done, they get boring to look at pretty quickly. Enemy AI is also pretty bad. Sometimes an enemy will see you, and then all of a sudden go back to patrolling. This is franchise has one of the easiest stealth systems ever, and Black Flag shares that curse. Enemies can't hear you running, enemies can't see you clearly sometimes, enemies walk across dead bodies sometimes, the list goes on. It's surprising that after five games, not even counting the PS Vita and PSP version, they can't add a simple little crouch button that games in 2004 had. Scaling also feels dumbed down and much easier. There's nothing special about it anymore, and there's a lack of interesting buildings.  Now... being a captain of a ship. Something an Assassin's Creed game has never aimed at. It's got it's share of good and bad. The good? Steering feels immersive. The atmosphere of captaining your own ship, and having a loyal crew of members working for you that all want the same thing. It's done well. Everyone's happy, having fun, but always ready to follow orders. Ship battles are also fun, but there's no real strategy involved. Jumping on to the enemy ship never gets old too in my opinion. There's no better feeling than ""I've disabled you ship, now I'm gonna jump on, kill your crew members, and force you to lower my bounty level!"". Hunting whales, dolphins, and sharks is cool the first few times you do it, but it gets boring after a while and doesn't feel too useful. Same with diving missions, it's cool at first and actually has it's own little stealth system, but feels useless. The world is also HUGE! But... the islands are small, and there was never any feeling that I ever wanted to explore any of them unless they had a collectible that I wanted at the time. There's only four islands that have full cities, the rest are either for trading or they're empty.  Edward is also probably the most unique character out of all the previous Assassins. The previous Assassins wanted Revenge, Freedom, Justice, Answers. Heroic type things like that. Edward? He wants to become rich and famous, which is fitting for the setting. His character model is also super badass. But despite all of this, he's not that interesting of a character. Bad thing's in his life happen, but somehow the player never really feels for him (except for maybe in the end). The story start's out right in the action, which is nice, but after that it sort of starts to lose its meaning. Of course, there's also the story that goes on in the modern day. I don't have many good things to say about it. It's unwanted and unnecessary. It's like immigration: an incredible boring and long process that you don't want to do, but it needs to be done for you to progress. Even though I'm not saying alot of good things about the story, don't get me wrong. It has it's moments that I wouldn't want to spoil for you, but it's taken over by too much bad.  Graphics and sound aren't too special in this game. Facial animations aren't the best, and the lighting isn't too great either. The resolution for texture's aren't that low, but they aren't very high for you to be amazed either. Voice acting is good, but the quality of all the other sound's are average, some even subpar. There's also some bugs. I didn't deal with too many, but I dealt with enough where I have to inform it. Nothing gamebreaking though. And no, I had no problems with Uplay. Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag doesn't do much to impress. Here and there, it's got some good things, and it captures the pirate aesthetic, but it's overtaken by a boring storyline, easy gameplay, a few bugs, some ""meh"" sounds and graphics, and there's really not much to do in the world. If you are thinking of buying this game,   buy it when it's on sale, or find a good price and buy it for the cheapest price you can find. ",False,False

4053,"Really. But recommend this game. Still, I am an absolute fan, but with a totally subjective opinion, of the original game on SNES. It is: - my all, very short RPG even; - my everything on console; - my of my college years; - my everything with my best friends; - my everything   ; - my everything, before owning Illusion of Time and other Secret of Evermore. Secret of Mana is also: -, baby (I still had a lot of cartridges that ended up in the videos of the Player in the Attic, it must be said); - not (too) boring to unlock all the attack levels of the game with the 3 characters and see their animations; - not (too) boring to unlock all the attack levels of the girl and the sprite to see the special animations of the highest level; - and stylish (Tigror, Mékano, the dragos and my favorite: Ténébro) ... and for some, a little bit of essentials (good magic, a good stock of nuts, respecting the timing); - ""basic"" enemies that can give (need to charge your weapons, attack timing to accumulate damage and prevent casts, healing timing, etc.). Secret of Mana is finally: - drifting with Flammie, for fun and for the glory of mode 7; - the search for the mysterious hidden armor of the game (THE myth of the last century); - the ""bug"" exploit to spam spells as quickly as possible or kill mobs on several levels. Most of the critics attack the graphics of the remake (basic, few animations and animations missing) or the choice not to have touched certain ""bugs"" (pathfinding picks it up) or even not to have added new passages (temples) or mechanical. All that does not matter to me. I would have liked it all. Too bad: I told myself that I should at least have the same feelings and my first hours were pretty good. Oh boy. . Secret of Mana, the remake, is: - different names, but not funny, nor impressive. GIVE ME back my Tigror, bordaile! -. Systematically: we arrive, the sprite spam 2-3 spells of the right type and pof dead. Oookéé ... We come to challenge ourselves: like, don't use magic. Suddenly, the lifespan of the bosses pass from 15 s 1 min ....... - which, them, become: spam arrows for some, for others (like, I raged like a pig on the spiders of the desert: they are bugged, it's unbelievable. Mud, mud, mud, diamond, full sprite, but whaaat). There are always invincible enemies with weapons and when they start spamming spells on the sprite the fun begins (eg 2-3 ""Eaunuage"" in the Ice Forest, Joy; 2-3 spiders buried in the Kakkara Desert ...); - this magic spam is crossed with the change (or the correction) of the chains of healing spells: they are now applied strictly in order. Conclusion: if a character is turned on - and it is frightfully often Popoi - no need to try to save him, it's too much; - as long as before, but. Popoi the pixie doesn't cast as quickly anymore and is often unavailable if you don't play him directly. Prim sets his spells leeeeentement ... and we do it directly at the hotel, on ourselves. Endlessly. Magic-sleep-magic-sleep. Nice; - also, all the same, it must be said. And all for MUCH TOO EXPENSIVE. Play Secret of Mana once in your life, but not this version.

4066,"I've been putting off writing this review for quite a bit, even as it may be useless now, I'd like to give my thoughts on the game. Undertale's disgustingly egregious fanbase hails this game as the literal ""Best Game Ever"", which would lead most to the conclusion that it's fairly deserving of such a title, yes? To say the least, I can't agree. Let's start with a simple pros and cons list. Pros Cons I'll go more into detail about the points I've brought up in my list. Undertale has a very well made story that can be incredibly engaging - unless you don't like the characters. If you cannot bring yourself to enjoy the personalities of the, mostly, over the top characters, you will not enjoy this game in the slightest. Otherwise, the story hooks you decently well and made me want to finish the game.  The soundtrack is decent.  . There are a good few tracks that definitely hype you up, or make you feel for the situation quite well. But in general, it's not too fantastic. I wouldn't hold it as a great soundtrack overall, however it still works as a pro. The artstyle is cute and can make some areas feel very comfortable or even pretty in some cases. The sprites in particular are really pleasant. The simple black on white/use of empty space creates a nice, floaty feel to the in battle sprites, a plus for me. Despite good feedback coming from Undertale, hearing two of my favorite genres clash together to create an essentially unheard of combo - a bullet hell RPG, was definitely something that drew me in. Although for the most part, the bullet hell aspect wasn't put to full use, I wish it had made the combat more fun than it was. But the ambition and combination is neat for sure. As stated before, the vast majority of the fans this game has churned out are straight up awful. Without ever seeking out anything related to Undertale beforehand, the fans could not seem to keep spoilers or constant shouting of the game's supposed greatness to themselves, leading me (and many others) to be exposed to spoilers early on. From my experience, most of the fans who see   remotely negative about their holy   game bash, insult, or attack the person with an opposing opinion. Gross obsession, incessant need to imitate characters from the game, and disturbing fanart/fanfiction makes it quite hard to even tolerate being anywhere near these fans. Definitely not a good influence the game has brought forth. The gameplay is barebones as all hell. If you're outside of combat, the gameplay isn't really there. Just a few minor puzzles and walking from A to B. Simplicity isn't a bad thing, but the game almost felt like an interactive narrative with combat thrown in due to how simple it was at times.  The settings weren't too great, felt quite bland and not too unique. Essentially a ""snow world"", ""water world"", and ""fire world"". Some had a few gimmicks like pushing snowballs or navigating platforms by steam launchers, but still boring (another aspect of the gameplay being bland).  This next one is one of the greatest flaws of Undertale, in my opinion. A game with choices should not encourage you to conclude with the one certain ending, and discourage any other conclusion. This felt really forced and wasn't something I enjoyed. For example, the   route (the only situation in the game where the combat is truly enjoyable) is discouraged against through the entire playthrough of it. The game  , which is laughable. Why wouldn't I want the full experience of the game I paid full price for? (I've heard it's because I should have come to care for these characters I've come to know in a short period of time, but why should it make other outcomes something to not pursue?) The combat in the game is boring and definitely did not have it's full potential put to use. The attack patterns are very easy to remember and don't change up much, leading the combat to become way too repetitive. ""ACT, avoid attack, ACT, avoid attack, MERCY"" over and over again. The jokes and ""funny"" moments thrown in to seemingly make the pacifist ""combat"" more enjoyable also become redundant.

4103,"There are a lot of JRPGs built on the RPG Maker engine of different beliefs. There are many aytes where fans of this case exchange knowledge and knowledge of the game with each other. One of these games is the Chosen RPG. She did it back in 2014 () As a fan of the craft, she was more or less, the default prizes and everything else here were just as impossible: a banal Yuzhet without revealing characters, a bunch of different locations, whose southern passage and behavior is not fully understood, music is banal banal design. Once upon a time, that game would have lived, but then the developers released it to the team, replaced the girls' primes with half-naked ones, changed practically all art: the hero dressed in extras, and the heroines, apparently, to buy extras for the hero, sold their things. About the south: it is banal, it feels like there were all possible cliches. Good and evil ... 2000 years ago ... the chosen one ... the sealed sword ... the only descendant ... the villain who wants to destroy and kill proto like that. Full set. For a free fanatical creation - for the most time. For a paid project, way and cheap ... tranno. The plot does not bring any legal prizes, its southern moves, like the bowl above, are banal. Do not take it into the pluses. Music here is usual for RPGMaker VX Ace, taken directly from the corresponding RTP. It's hard to spoil it. The design was overwhelmed. Why was there a change? No location design. A strange arrangement of things in some rooms, a bunch of closed houses, potions lying in the most unusual places. You can go through the shadows with the meta, apparently, the boundaries were not set. There are game bugs: you can swing on the trash of the ice temple to infinity, having a bunch of wings (which are not needed). He was beaten, and he attacks and attacks. Or is she? The game is extremely short, which is what it is. The only side quest is finding the best weapon for the characters, each one being obvious. Sometimes he wants a map of the world, but that desire will not. A game without a soul, which, according to the final credits, hints at a sequel. Indeed, it is. Chosen II: Edge's Liberation, 2014 release. What's good about the game? Cards? Here you go. For some reason in the game there is still a howling ""zapukator"", which will povlet before the game. Why? what? No answer. There are no advanced options, no window resizing, no guarding of past actions in battle, but guarding in any meta outside the battlefield. It's dull. Although obvious. The scripts were taken by others, but they were taken in insufficient quantity. In the same paragraph, add a non-crawling text to the dialog windows. Were the developers even too lazy to go through the game before releasing it on Steam and watch such a problematic meta? It seems that it was bypassed only by replacing the prizes with the characters. Would you like something broads, southern, grind and no hent? Get Hero and Daughter + or Ella's Hope (from Aldorlea Games). Do you want to grind with yuzhet, broads and hentai? Place Brave Soul. Do you want a soulful game with a southerner and without women? Place the free Frozen World made by one person (and Chosen RPG, by the way, made by four). Even the Cthulhu Saves the World & Breath of Death VII Double Pack, which can be purchased in the team, will do. Do you want a soulful game of yogurt, broads, internal achievements and clan hand localization from fans? Put ""Itoriya hero"" (aka Hero's Quest). Want something different?

Again he runs into the map, and the cartridges are not infinite. and even AI can not show, I do not know how to evaluate this characteristic. A crowd of me on the missions of Hearts and Minds poured quite often. - For the gameplay, too, 6, because I saw nothing new.

While Nightdave poured a lot of vitality in graphics,  setting of Strife desperately craves for a more advanced engine. Doom engine is good for abstract techobases mingled with hell sceneries, dismal dungeons and ominous castles of Doom, Heretic and Hexen respectively, but (unless  heavily tweaked) when it is meddling with story and characters, then, a final result leaves kinda like vapid taste.The further you advance, the more blurred it becomes, until finally dissolves into frame on an unremarkable shooter. Even that, If Strife was released a year or two later on a different engine, it would probably outshine even some major names in fps genre, just for being the first.  If you looking for some education on fps genre, then, Strife probably worth looking for some historical enlightenment.

I believe that real players in this series will have some unique memories, one generation of dogs, second generations of hands, three generations chasing everywhere, four generations of rubber people walking all over the floor, five generations of licking, six generations of living...but this segment That's it. Biomechanical 7, no enemies that can make memories fresh, no third-person, no big scene, no characters we are familiar with, no continuation of any main story that we expect, no mercenary model that can continue The external content of the game life force, hiding some enemies in Play will also make it appear instantly. So, if you take this game one word and treat the straight machine photos as a tribute to the biochemical machine series, then you will see that there is nothing wrong with it (manual BBTCat) *** The following content is serious*** *** Some worthy of our consideration Something*** Although the whole tour experience makes people feel very ""empty, but what I have to say is that the atmosphere in the house is always wrong. The depth of field of light and shadow effects and the jungle scene also express the vitality of the new engine vividly. Although hiding the enemy from the cruise festival will make you feel like you are playing other games, but the same line of decryption elements, top games, archive storage boxes and collections of people will also make you indulge in it. It is worth noting that part of the game is recorded. Bringing the story content can make players with mild tastes feel comfortable, and it will be easier to cause 3D vertigo symptoms when the frame rate is sufficient. Due to the strength of the ending, the lack of the biochemical series plots and many problems of Chinese language, we can start here.

So you don't have to grind for months to level up your character. Some people call that pay to win. I call it lazy. Would be so much better if the shop only would sell cosmetic items.

4177,"Typically I only review games which I feel very passionate about, meaning that pretty much all of my reviews are positive. However considering just how bad I found this game to be, combined with the asking price of 20 Euro, I felt the need to write a review just to give a heads up to any of my friends that might be considering this purchase. I bought Submerged on sale for 2 Euro, and while I didn't have the highest of expectations I did think that at the very least it would provide for a relaxing experience. However, after actually playing the game it made me question if it was even worth the 2 Euro I had spent, let alone the normal asking price. To clarify, I am saying this all as someone who has a love for many games which are short, simple, and cost around the same price as Submerged. By no means does short or simple mean a game is boring or cannot be a wonderful experience. However the difference is that those games actually offer things which make them a worthwhile experience in one way or another, while I really didn't find anything about Submerged redeeeming and struggle to call it an experience at all. To sum up my reasoning I'll simply list it as such: • The gameplay consists of nothing more than driving your boat around to various buildings and then climbing said buildings to find supplies. Once you have scaled one building you've pretty much scaled them all, there really isn't much (if any) variety in these structures or how you explore them. You can't even enter any of these buildings, you simply climb up one after another, each pretty much a clone of the previous one. • To add to this, the mechanics are extremely clunky. Basically the only two things you do in the entire game are drive your boat around and climb buildings, and the mechanics for both of these things reeks of a complete and total lack of polish. I tried playing both with my keyboard and mouse and my controller, and while I found the controller to be the best option it still didn't take away from just how awkward these controls are. • You can't die or even take any injury. This isn't necessarily a bad thing of course, but considering just how boring the game is already, this makes for a complete and total lack of any kind of suspense and really just made everything feel all that more bland. • The best part of the entire game for me is the wildlife, as you will sometimes see a whale, dolphin, or a select few other creatures. Provided there are very few, but it is at least something that helps the world not feel completely dead. However this quickly lost its charm for me when I accidentally ran into a whale, only to find that I bounced right off of it as though I was driving a bumper car. For a game such as this that is pretty much relying on the environment, this really doesn't do any favors for the feeling of immersion. • For a brief period of time I was actually interested in the storyline and it was pretty much the only thing that kept me from quitting and requesting a refund. However the ending of the story is very much like the actual gameplay- extremely underwhelming.  • I've seen some positive reviews which call the game beautiful or even gorgeous. Of course this is subjective, but I really didn't find anything about the way the world is crafted to be nearly impressive enough to describe it in nearly such enthusiastic terms. At first glance it is pretty at best, but after just a short amount of exploration I found that the scenery is very repetitive. Save for a few landmarks (which are really nothing special), everything really looks the same.  I can appreciate what Submerged was going for, and feel that the focus might have been intended to be on the world rather than the actual gameplay, something that can be great when done right. However with Submerged it ultimately falls flat, and between an underwhelming world and the underwhelming gameplay what you're left with is a game that feels much too empty to even be appreciated for being relaxing. Overall, more simplistic games such as this can be a very rewarding experience if done well, but sadly I really can't say there's anything that Submerged gets right. Of course you might feel differently than me, but I urge you to at the very least wait until a sale, because this is absolutely not worth the 20 Euro price tag. ",False,False

First issue I found, was the gamma/brightness, either it was to dark or to bright and very blurry looking. Having it set at 50% I could not navigate dark areas it was that dark (pitch black)   Moving became impossible in the dark, so much so, I had to put the gamma/brightness at 100% to be able to move out from where I was on four occasions, clearly not a good sign Graphically, it was okay, apart from purple blood. Now, correct me if I am wrong, is blood purple? I can forgive most things in games, but not that, unless the devs know some pretty strange folk that bleed purple blood. Some may say ""you did'nt give it a chance"" or ""you have not played it for long"" so how can I comment on it? Well, its like this........................

After forty minutes, you make an excuse for the lavvie/toilet, and don't return/refund.

Watch the French film martyrs instead or the Chinese film Dream home if you want gore and brutality, as they make this game look like bedknobs and broomsticks. I had more fun playing Inmates and Silent descent (hint). Unless it gets modded or patched to make it realistic and playable, I will give it a wide berth.

4234,"Note: This is not an in-game review dated 19th August 2020. EDIT 1 as of 20th August 2020:  My in-game hours stopped clocking in at 5.5hours and stayed there even though it took me another 6 hours to completely finish downloading. So total downloading time for me is actually 11.5 hours but it only registered as 5.5. Still way past the point of refunding. After sourcing MFS Steam forums led me to this post on Reddit In short the solution I got was different from what was posted cuz I misread the path but somehow it managed to work for me so as a caution only FOLLOW THESE STEPS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I have no idea what will happen on your system, somehow it worked for me. What I did was I went into C://Users/*myusername*/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft Flight Simulator/Packages/Official/Steam From there I sorted the most recent items and as with the Reddit posting, deleted the 5 most items in that folder, all of mine was an ""FSPATCH File"". After which I loaded the game, updated it and lo-behold it continued to download from the last 3GB that was stuck for me. Do note for my case I still had to wait another 6 hours to fully completely download what I was missing, but I'm just glad it was stuck. So now the game has fully downloaded, I can finally take to the skies or at least try. See you guys in the air or run way. ------------------ TL;DR: Rough lift off due to download/launcher issue, but who knows it might be clear skies after the initial turbulence. This review is just to highlight the installation of the game in a way. As of 5 hours of ""playing"" time solely consists of downloading the game which counts as in-game time. This is due to the fact that downloading from Steam will only download the launcher for MFS. Through the launcher is where you will require to download the full 91GB of the game itself. Due to some reason it takes hours to download the game, and that in of itself can result in freezing and CTD so you have to rinse and repeat until it is done. While having the MFS launcher open, all this counts towards in-game time as mentioned earlier. This is an issue for those who played the game, dislike it or can't run it on their system and want to refund it. So do take note of that before grabbing this.

4252,"first grabbed my attention with its steampunk style which I utterly love, however, the next thing I noticed was all the negative reviews. I took a moment to glance through them and thought: “it can’t be that bad. I’m sure people are just being overdramatic and it was also on sale. Oh was I so wrong!   Starting up the game, you’re asked information on how you’d like to view the adult content throughout: all, none, light, etc. Pick your option and away you go.    Stepping into the shoes of one Tirs something-or-other you are instantly made into a crappy boyfriend who constantly makes his long-term other-half second to his desires and future career. Needless to say, Tirs isn’t the nicest person in the world but he’s a genius so who cares, right? Well, obviously his boyfriend did as he dumps Tirs’ sorry arse. This leads our MC to throw himself further into his career goals, leading him directly into the lap of one, professor Marc...  into his lap. Now, here’s where things get really interesting plot wise; Early on in the game, Marc propositions Tirs to see if he wants to “blow off some steam casually. You can completely refuse – but doing so leads you steadily to a bad ending only! In other words, it may be consensual between the two men but as the player, you are forced into this act if you have any plans of reaching an ending with any of the three LI’s.   This forced   happens again further down the line. If you want to get off of Marc’s route and onto one of the none psychos routes, you have to once again, agree to shag Marc but this time, as a threesome. I can very much see why this … “interesting idea by the devs had caused a lot of backlash.    The whole plot of this game isn’t much better. It is hugely ambition but aims higher than it can deliver. Heavy topics such as blackmail, threats, accidental murder and kidnapping – just to name a few – are bland and lacking any real emotion. Example, the murder thing; there’s a single statement that he feels bad about it but no other mention until the end of a good route which, once again, it’s a measly line or two. There’s just no impact! The sheer amount of grammatical errors do nothing to help the situation either!     The description clearly states “Key scenes have voice acting! but it feels rather random. If I were to hazard a guess, I’d say that the voice actors were given their lines but with no instructions other than that. “Tirs the MC is sometimes called “Tears and other times as “Turs. At the very least, have everyone know how to say the damn guy's name!   As for the art, as stated before, I am a lover of the steampunk style and it is what original drew me in but even this was ruined. A select few characters just look weird while on screen together. I’m no artist but it’s like the LI’s were given the most attention while the supporting characters weren’t given as much detail.

4282,"*Ahem* sorry... Material Girl is a hentai “adventure game made by Dieselmine, which feels more like a CG Collector game than a proper game. For starters there’s pretty much no plot. The whole game can be summed up as “Sakura needs money to pay the bills, so she searches for part-time jobs and ends up getting abused in multiple ways by different people. I can more or less forgive a game for having an excuse plot if there’s some sort of plot progression but this game even lacks that. Once you get past the 2 deadlines (which are very easy to do tbh) you’re left to your own devices without anything to do aside from finding different ways to get Sakura corrupted (read: r4ped) and  her out once her lewdness meter is high enough. What makes it even worse is its terribad translation. Machine-translated games are notorious for having awkward dialogues that barely make any sense to anyone who knows the language it was translated to (let alone native speakers) but this one also has numerous typos, odd line breaks, and some naming inconsistencies to boot. To give you an idea of how bad it is I spent more time pressing the “skip dialogue key than reading it. The only thing that keeps this game away from being an absolute disaster is the art. It’s quite decent if you ask me, even though it’s censored and there are a few CG that may look odd (how long is that foot fetishist’s tongue btw?). They even animated a few of the scenes, which is an unexpected plus. In short, I can’t recommend it.

A few years ago, Ubi tried to censor Rainbow Six: Siege to bring it to the Chinese market, rather than making two separate versions, as most other companies do, they decided to cut the ""worldwide"" version. skulls, gambling and blood. Yes, blood in the FPS game. The saddest thing is that in China there is no explicit rule that skulls are not allowed - Ubi has self-censored ahead of time. If preventive self-censorship isn't the most cowardly thing you can think of, I don't know what is. So you say it's just cosmetics, who cares? Normally I would agree, but what matters is the reason - video games are at heart a creative medium and should not be at the mercy of a totalitarian government. In any case, due to public outcry, Ubi pulled out ... and ... instead they have been quietly updating their maps over the years, slowly all these things are disappearing in the non-Chinese, official version. Theme Park lost all drug presentations (cocaine bags) and the name ""Drug Lab"" was renamed ""Lab. Sneaky as hell. Last season, the Skyscraper map was reworked to remove all depictions of drugs, cash, as well as signs of a shootout (blood spatter, bullets, gang activity, etc.). It is now 100% ""sanitized"". For those of you who aren't aware of it, the game is about a siege of a building, so thematically it makes sense that there may have been criminal activity in this building. The game is meant to serve the community and this game only serves as a great ATM for the developers. I'm waiting for x updates to start shooting bubbles, and the weapons will make sounds like little girls from Chinese fairy tales or other, fuck knows what market to please the richest, for profit, not general, for the game itself.

4323,"Very poorly executed. The game had so much potential. A brilliant premise yet so so poorly done. The game would have been much better if time had been spent on making the game more fun and immersive experience rather than adding two boring and pointless DLC's. The main goal of the game is to survive as a group in a war-torn house, while also going out at night to scavenge for supplies or barter with NPC characters. Simple, yet theoretically it could have been a great game. However, The game lacks in many parts that would have made it immensely more intriguing and fun. This includes stealth, which currently is a hot pile of messy garbage. I can not think of a game that has a more poorly executed stealth mechanic that is essentially one of the main parts of the game. It's a real tragedy that the stealth was mundane and implemented in a way that can be criticised so easily, although the scavenging, in general, was quite intriguing in the sense of managing your items and what to take back and what to leave behind for another time. This too caused problems though, with the game relying on you having supplies during the day time sequence. So if you decide to have a haul of primarily not materials, you will be stuck in the day section with not much to do, but watch your characters eat and sleep. It also lacks in terms of immersion, at no point in this game was I at all worried or frightful of what would happen to my characters during the night time because all that is required is one character to be placed on guard, and you will not be raided. The only part of the game that I can give a strong positive is the ethical implications of greed during wartime. At times in the game, you will be scavenging for supplies and come across a hospital, for example. You either have the choice of not stealing the medical supplies from the hospital and putting lives in danger or leaving them and going to scavenge from a non-civillian place etc. This made me feel some form of empathy however, not powerful enough for me to think twice about stealing from old and sick people. Due to the reasons that have been discussed, I will be giving this game a negative review. It could have been so much more, and it is disappointing to see such a great idea to be so poorly executed.

Whoever made that decision is the reason why this game has such horrific reviews. The animations, Frame Rates and over all clunky feeling the ENTIRE game has is most likely due to the engine being Unity 3D. Watch as you get a solid maybe 70 frames, then your sensitivity will skyrocket as your FPS dips to like 20 and it picks it back up. I ran this game in 1440p, on the lowest settings with a 2080TI and the entire time the game is open your GPU will be hard stuck at 99% usage the entire time this game is open.  Thats the Unity 3D engine for ya. Second stop on this ride is the Animations. A disaster in itself. NONE of the animations I saw ran smoothly/correctly. Many times your gun (Especially the magnum) will clip back to the last frame of the shooting animation, so it just jitters back and forth sometimes. The enemy movement is choppy, and whenever you kill anyone they all to the SAME EXACT death animation every single time. Think of a T pose, but with them holding a finger pistol and then just toppling over. On every single enemy. Completely ruins the immersion every time you kill someone. In a nutshell this is how animations are -   : 3 minutes of just WTF. Basically in the entire game Graphical wise - I didn't see many issues. It looked good when standing still, hence why the screenshots make the game look amazing on the store page.  AI in this game is also just a mess. I played on the second to last hardest difficulty. So basically hard, and in-between trying to aim correctly with the   and messed up animation you can basically just click once on their head and their dead. I barely ever even checked my health unless I was getting sniped, without the snipers and bazookas the damage input to you is next to nothing. I played up until the mission where you go into the tent to bug the guys office. No matter what I did, I always failed the mission as soon as I planted the bug. I hid bodies, did everything but as soon as the guy spawns in it was game over. After 2 tries at that, I gave up and started writing the review. In a nutshell, I do not see many of these issues getting fixed with the current engine and I do not ever see this game going above ""Mixed"" reviews on steam. Why they thought this was ready to roll out as a completed game is beyond me and is now on my list for THE worst remake I have ever played.

Someone didn’t name the quiet brilliant developers (well, except that, except for Todd Howard, he just fucking teases over naive fans) I’ll give an example: 1) Hideo Genius Kajima - bodies, I run shorter across the field and somewhere else, and then bang me they killed and x * d understand where they killed me here and the bodies, Hidetaka Mizaki - unpredictable falsity of mobs, drove in a crowd to one point and they fucked me and so 1, 2 and shorter more than a trillion times and then bang their milestones, here You can't predict the falsehood of mobs, Shinji Mikami - Survival Horror, in short, I ran into the hut, I rob the cartridges and I think that I’ll start to save cartridges and stupidly bypass the opponents, and then the fucker flies out from around the corner and shoots me, saying that it’s okay not to tell, he died and almost got to heaven and then St. Peter says to me ""Why are you fucking dying from that game, piz * ouy back you still have a lot of sh * t to go through and endure some degenerates"" and returned me about the shortness of the meteorite back to Earth, here's the Survivor and the fucking Ugly, Dvid Kay j - linear storytelling, running as a friend, we got into the hut in a shorter time and then bam killed him, he was tear-stained and with a promise to otvetit went off to avenge and they fucked me up, and so during the next ""repeated"" passage, they kill me, and a friend, as he thinks to be the best friends, screams ""Mokva voronezh x * y catch up"" already fucked * l and as a result spent somewhere in the artyr almost to the end of the south and fucked 2 last fuckers and he was top 1, grandmothers, heifers, em, payment for a mortgage and die of babbling, here's a non-linear storytelling where you can decide how you will unfold the Yuzhet. How did you understand proto roflu, because that proto miserable r * nb, where you take out, run, steal loot in the end did not even trill at all, you were killed and ate the trell, then they also killed or proto until the end of ei you can pass on one meta and so every time , intereno well, proto piz * ets, plus more bugs, brakes and other x * eta. Bottom line: This is not a game, then, like Fallout 76, it is a non-playable garbage dump of a stupid community. I am not an online player, except that in 2014 I played Payday 2, at that time I was very ah * Renna, and then already in 2015 I already bent and never abandoned it, but in 2017 I played on Friday 13 about the day of the release, and it was kind of good at first , roflily, kekali and proto fix these bugs and other shit and as a result, after 3 months the game completely bent, and so it is rare for me to shut up a multiplayer game, and so I decided in 2018 somewhere in June to buy this game, or rather To my friend and howl, and put 20 hours I regretted the money 1200 for two copies and until then I regret it, fortunately, I pushed it as a vicar, in the end it would be better to swell the 900 than buy that p * n, don't be like that, don't buy that Rating: 2 Frying pan out of 5.

But Gears 5 has way to many issues from Balancing, Crashing, Game Breaking Glitches, Horrible Levels in my opinion new to Gears 5 like Bunker, Half the new maps are from Gears of War 4 it seems and those are the only ones I can even find enjoyment on. The gun play has issues, the Lancer doesn't play like the Lancer did in previous games and it didn't need to change in my opinion. Escape mode feels like a side game mode you'll only play for the god awful Tour of Duty unlocks which most times are useless garbage like blood sprays or banners. And horde mode alone is what kept me drawn to games over the years, I don't even have any excitement in me to play the Horde mode it's that bad. The mechanics of it alone and the way it handles characters is even bad. The campaign as a story was honestly great, at the end I was a bit emotional. But there are so many segments in it that were so bad due to level design alone and the AI. I played Gears of war 4 least twice a week during the last year and a half of it's time, I even got to Wings 2. But Gears 5 just has nothing there to make me wanna come back and continue playing now that I beat the campaign. And the microtransactions are just awful, I mean yeah you know what you're buying but the prices, it's just bad. You're telling me a blood spray is worth $7.00, are you serious? I could get my self a cheap lunch with that money. or the 200 Iron Toast mark, $2.00 for your markers to look like a pair of toast? For $2.00 I could get a loaf of bread and actually make toast with a toaster I have in the kitchen.  At first I thought Gears of War 4's gear packs were bad, but Gear's 5 unlocks and transactions are officially worse in my eyes.  If the review text limit was infinite I could honestly list out every good and bad thing I think about with Gears 5. There are good parts yes, but there's just so much bad with it that it actually keeps me from even wanting to play it. If you love a good story, get the game. But that's all I can really suggest. But till they do things back to how they were I can't really say get this game. At the time of writing this I have 58 hours for the game and I'm already not wanting to come back to it, which is honestly sad for someone who loves Gears. And I actually did try writing a full out review with my thoughts of every positive and flaw of the game but I reached the character limit so I have to settle with this. The joy. ",False,False

4359,"He wants to put in his mouth and drown in the urine of the one who has bothered the regimes. The 2 modes are perfectly balanced proto. I don’t want to rattle, but come, because when we played in trikeball mode, one team defends the point, and the second one attacks, the attackers had an infinite number of repaves, and the defenders had 2 lives per game. This was done by the fact that the defenders have predominantly position and information, they know where the attackers are coming from and are well prepared, the enemies only know the positions of the defenders when they die, when the defenders, in principle, propose and listen / motrt certain entry points. Immediately in the game, some clever chelik decided, but let's make a mode in which we play against the attackers. As a result, we have a regime where the attackers have 5 lives, when the defenders have 20. Takes have to run 200+ meters, and the defenders 40-60. so I can’t find out where the defenders are except to die near them, and the defenders know the direction of the attack. Do you think you? No, no, time also plays in the direction of the defenders, if you don't capture the point in 8 minutes, then you will lose, and the defenders, at least henna, go on your ass and don't worry, the enemies will come)). As a result, we have a mode in which the defenders have predominantly positioning, by time, by the number of lives (it is not clear why the defenders ate 20 lives, they die at least once every 2 minutes) and according to information. A very fair regime, you need to kill absolutely all the defenders to capture the point, otherwise the newly arrived defenders will throw grenades at the proto, and they will arrive many more times. Well, in that mode, such a moronic implementation was. Go ahead, a mode where milestones have one life before capturing a point. Here you play like that, and here both of them, well, here it is, that there are about 6 people and there are 5 people about enemies, and the Bravo point is not captured. Some of yours will manage to capture Bravo, because the enemies are also focused on their point of Charlie. AND OP VS ALREADY 14 PEOPLE? WHAT PTSY? CAPTURE THE POINT IN 5 PEOPLE?)))) DO YOU POP SHOE SHS ALWAYS HAVE))). Disbalan on the face, who won the first neutral point, you can not try further. Otalny two modes - I have no complaints. Now complaints about the game. The game is terribly inconvenient, very slow and, in general, a paradise for any tankit, take a position higher, take a semi-automatic rifle and have one-shot cheliks running past. Try to play with ppshki or shotguns in that game?) Throw them into the trash, most of the time they will kill 10+ meters on a ratonia, you will not be given the chance to be near the enemy, and if you eat and be close, they pray that he will not shoot you a howling rifle shot from hips at random. The system of throwing grenades is terribly inconvenient, do you want to quickly push it under the stucco? 2 seconds to hit it, 1 second to throw it, half a second to detonate it, and 1 second to hit the trunk back. ~ 3.5 seconds of idle time, for a shooter it was a lot, especially for one where any weapon kills for a burt or wiped out. The game itself does not suit me and is too slow for my type of game, but the mode balancer is advised to make friends with logic and begin to understand who needs to be taken advantage of and who needs to be added.

I have nothing to say about the campaign, an ordinary prodigy at the level of Polish shooters, but most of them buy these games not for the sake of the campaign, but for the sake of a network game. And she confused Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, a childish game, so, for the sake of equality, and in general, it was sad. Thought-out maps, excellent hit item, a variety of weapons with a normal shot sound. It is impossible even to equate. What do you need to eat or smoke in order to do it like that, which was already done about 10 years ago ??? I knew that it would be obscene, not a game, then about CoD WW2, but I did not think that it would be so hellish. achina from graphics in multiplayer, blurry textures, vomit ero-brown gamut, wretched maps, more precisely, haoom sculpted from the lantern, opponents coming out of nowhere, ping, as if I'm not even playing Mara, but another galaxy in general, and to loading cranes 5 minutes each. Plus, a very important moment for me personally, it is absolutely impossible to distinguish the enemy player from your players visually, in the shape and color of the uniform, as it was in the same CoD MW2, where, the trill of a helicopter machine gun, could easily distinguish where the voy is and where abreks even in monochrome. She is the only opportunity to distinguish who is who, then wait until it is clear what color of the nickname is. Because of that, in hard modes, there are a huge number of murders of your own players. hey what? So that some schoolboy could create a peronage - a negro about trashes on a backpack? Didn't they mix up the games? And it takes as much as 90 GB ??? Come on, right? She doesn't even want to mention the presence of cheaters of milestones, it is already becoming the norm, unfortunately. It was hoped that the field of that running through the shadows was doing something more real and playable, but ET! I remember ve hali CoD Ghosts when it came out. So, by comparison with the last ""masterpiece"", Ghosts is the pinnacle of the game industry, no kidding. For me, the game is very successful in that series, then, no matter how tranno, CoD Advanced Warfare! It was like a breath of fresh air for a franchise, no matter who copied what. Everything that came out of the field, each time ""broke through the next bottom."" It's sad.

Character seems like tiny flea, you can't connect with her, I think this was done to hide the blurred textures. Clearly, the developer is not skilled with Unreal Engine. Combat is the biggest let down, all attacks just feel poorly implemented, just a combination of light/heavy and ranged attack. Combat animations are clunky and slow, due to excessive animation frames. I couldn't make out the character moves and animations on a 24 inch Screen, had to sit right up close to it. Tutorials are confusing and your character gets stuck, so, you will have to start playing from beginning. Game ends abruptly with no option to quit and restarts the game.

4461,"I know I can write a negative review on a game in which I ran 60 hours of trannos, but no. Idea DS2 is good - take the best from the first and increase it many times. then at times. And a little more up. And ... oh, what happened ?! As a result, the game has a few good wilted chicks that drown in some kind of unhealthy routine and huge locations. When I wrote that I liked the first part, they immediately wrote in the comments that they read it bad, at least because of a bunch of climbing / scrambling / jumping. And yes, at the end of DS1 there were too many riddles that were proto introduced into the cookie, but the battles were bought - Voina was a mother of bo on blades. DS2 will make it almost HALF from mysteries and research. This is a proto at how much and the main thing is that the game does not even care about being limited in that. So you started the game, swinging along the road and you see a whole fortress in the feces ... try to climb like this, and find your way inside, cool! Iledovani, discoverer spirit! but then the door is closed inside and there is some hint that you need both stimulation. And ... ... yuda 15 minutes zazr broke ?! And so it will be every time the player wants to find out what he finds outside the main road or quarter until about the middle of the game. Then, for some reason, Diablo mechanics were added to the game - the items have a level, quality and voity. Ve pumps or steals. There is no other soap in that, except for the x100 grind. oh even there is a catch, read the wiki ponl, that during the passage you get some cool items, in the description of which it is not said about any other voytva and some things are off until the end of the game. Before him, objects do not fall out like the theft of lives, after receiving which the falsehood falls to zero. The only weak ptno - two branches of development, in such a necromancer-summoner (a miracle how good!) And a good damage dealer (no worse, but trite). here weapons of different types will not impress at all, it seems like it features shortness and damage, but the main thing is that there are necessary types of + to crit or magic. The plot delighted me somewhere within the first world, then it was banal. There was something original. Actually put it on until the end, which will be better further, but it did not melt - the end cuts off the branching forever. An attempt to take the south of two games is not bad, but Korea breeds holes and inconsistencies. English voice acting - boozy booby. The main character had to be called Khilk-Dokhlk, he barely tends to Death even by the end of the game, but the people around him will scoff with or without reason. In addition, for some reason, they added an arena for 100 waves, which can be completed only on the second playthrough. And he absolutely didn't care about balan - a couple of times he died from one blow where he had never met any problems before. The visual part pleased me more - gorgeous views, beautiful and different locations and ... very sultry girls of milestones and subspecies. The music in the first location is completely unexpected (new age, or something), in the battle, the boom felt creepy, but then nothing of that melted. As a result, the game was about creep in a couple of weeks in Korea, because I had not played diabloids for a very long time and I liked the world of DS, but the game was not happy about it.

4485,"Well, finally, without difficulty, I interrogated her inglplayer movie store. Passed about vemi dl and wanted to write a review in full. In general, the game flies into her with almost complete copying of gameplay features from Itok (who would have thought, the game was ready at the time of the release of Itok and was developed for a year). But what can we say, then, as there was a tree of gameplay features of other games, it was gone. However, the battlefield was melting better, thanks to the mine on the pin from the debris. However, Itokov combat aain tala is something boring for me. Before, it was possible to kill the enemy with 2-3 blows, or start a series of blows, which made the fight not boring and rather fast. because an RPG game is a matter of taste. The nimations so far look quite sharp and not realistic, but up the mountain lekio (I know that Kaandra canon, but it is dark and was made for the sake of femme women, so fuck it like yy) crawls up the mountain on a flat surface. Yes, it would be hard to make each mountain by hand, but after all, the developers had a whole year and a program that ama pushed the views in cities about the second chat. Why was it not possible to finalize it and spend an extra year on finishing up parkour with animations, and not on making bland movies for money? On the whole, if you didn't pay attention to that, playing tanovit is even comfortable. I can’t say anything about the south. In terms of aain, he is none, because neither the one nor the other in the game, only their pitiful likeness. he is not bad in principle and can be played. A kind of Witcher 3 on ultra minimal and wretched novels. However, it is full of illogicalities and breakdowns of lore too. I will begin to rob him for holes, because the ""smart guys"" will come running and accuse me of patronizing one pretty well-known Swede in the fndom. However, I give a fuck, and once I want to talk about a couple of illogical things. First, why the hell are we given the choice between lekyo and Kaandra? The CAVITY game is the same for them. This is not possible within the framework of logic, because each of them has vivid memories. If Kaandra canon, then the departure from logic and the choice of lekioa, we should play for, but no, smart yubi think that two different people can have the same story. Okay, I know that they seem to me like she says ""only the player sees the dialog boxes, but in the same game neither Layla nor the gg can see them. Okay, that would be an explanation if there were more than one"" but "". At the beginning of the game, Victory asks who we want to choose, which means that nothing should have been changed in my game. Okay, we decided on the choice of the pen. Now I want to talk about imbovot the spear. Sorry, but can you find out what that spear can’t do? In the game, it flies into an ideal weapon, because it’s like a proto on impossible things. Okay, invisibility, which can be embraced, but what about the poisoning and fire of weapons / trill? Many types of sayings that they set fire to them and ignite, but in my game, you can see that he does something with a spear. ? How does the spear of the mine help the gg not turn into mince when the proto coloal height falls? Teleportation from enemy to enemy from cover? (What was stolen from the last game about the btman). Many say that gg proto ""runs up"" quickly. then why the hell can he cross the 20 meter canyon do you run across? I will not say anything about the features of the pooh / mine from DL about Tlantida. This is a clear rape of the chitits lore who came from the second chat. Now a couple of fishing for dl. The first dl is pretty good and I liked it even, but .... it's not dl, but a cut out of the southern campaign. I'm serious, the ending of the first dl should be the ending of the original game and I'm sure that was the case initially. About the second dl I can not say definitely. I liked the water, but ... again, the dl turns the game into running around with weapons as old as vet swords. If in Itoki the sword from Final Fantasy was added as a response from the developers to the event by the Aainami in the finale, then these weapons are almost imperceptible. Yes, and as I said above, the possibility of pooh ... is impossible within the framework of the tarry lore about artifacts. In general, these are good lengths that you can not go through. From the atmosphere of Ancient Greece, I can say that it is very excellent. Yubis know how to design cards and create atmosphere of fun, however, indulging ""minorities"" kills their own games. As a result, you can fish about the game porn. If you don’t look that the title is ""Assassin's Creed"", then you can play. After all, that game was not originally like a part of the ordered Aain and its proto was roughly dragged to it. The arabs are not to blame for the fact that their original idea was not read as part of a new game in the series. But the game is not bad for them. About 6 out of 10 tonnes.

4490,"is a creative and beautiful but mostly tiresome puzzle game. As is so often the case with games in this genre, the story isn't exactly complex. The player takes on the role of a nameless protagonist who awakens in a mysterious and surreal world. Over four chapters, two spheres of light provide fragmentary insights into the life of the country's former inhabitants. In between there are ~ 70 puzzles to be solved and 46 optional challenges to be completed. The puzzle design is extremely innovative. Each level consists of a world of light and a shadow, between which the protagonist can travel back and forth via portals (limited) and gates (permanent) to build bridges and overcome fences. As soon as the goal has been achieved, the level is expanded and new paths, new objects and a new optional goal in the form of a scroll appear. Now you can either leave the level or accept the additional challenge. This concept was implemented excellently in the first chapter and the first half of the second chapter. Never before have I seen so many puzzles in a game characterized by out-of-the-box thinking as in - not even with genre greats like or. But from the second half of the second chapter the game becomes monotonous and boring - especially if you want to complete the optional challenges, because you often have to solve the whole level again. The feeling of boredom is intensified by the fact that the walking pace of the protagonist is excruciatingly slow. Towards the end, the game becomes a real memory trainer, as it is not uncommon for you to forget about possible solutions during the long walks. In addition, the level of detail in the intermediate world is rapidly decreasing. So at the beginning you explore a multi-faceted, colorful world and in the second chapter you only stand on a boring elevator platform. This development culminates in the fact that in the last chapter you climb a dark mountain that looks the same at every corner. Presumably this should underpin the plot and raise the atmosphere, but instead the motivation to continue playing is reduced, because there are nowhere shortcuts or secrets to discover. The only thing left is the linear path from puzzle to bonus challenge to puzzle to bonus challenge. It's a shame the game couldn't maintain its initial strengths. For me, two-thirds of my playing time felt like work - not fun. ",False,False

4508,"Immortal Realms: Vampire Wars, the RANT review: Having played the beta for over 20 hours (i had to push myself tbh) it already was clear that this game would fall short. The concept is nice tho, i won't deny it, but the execution is very poorly done to say the least! (they basically left the beta running for over 6 months while changing little to nothing, how or why one does that goes beyond my comprehension?) This game tries so hard but delivers little, making it look, act and feel underqualified & unpolished in pretty much all aspects. (confirmed: missing card mechanics, disappearing units, corrupted save/load files, etc..) It has choppy/glitchy motion & user interfaces, little to no real strategic values, bland and boring maps, not to mention the severe lack of diversity for 'terrain & cover systems' and whatnot (which does practically nothing for archer/ranged types). Unit types that are not offering much, except some basic stats like buffs & boons even on highest tier and leveling them up should also have been made more transparent. Terrible story, bad acting, uninspiring voices (grunting and moaning basically) low quality FMV, mindless plot,.. Boring!! (Ooh, i would almost forget to mention about the awkward camera movement or functionality.. It's as if you're always mistaking left from right by the simplest of actions!) The battle maps pretty much all look the same really, they're way too small, feel overly cramped, are full of stupid choke points to get bogged into, and offer practically zero contribution to the trategic value of the game (in other words, potential wasted).. It's also worth mentioning that whenever an enemy lord plays a card, you need to focus in quickly or miss it, leaving you wondering what he/she actually played?! The soundtrack (strong point) and overall visuals aren't bad, i'll give them that. But as the game stands now, there's plenty of patching and polishing up to do in order to make things look, feel and behave like it should because my impression is that at some time during the development they ran out of steam (or didn't even care to read our comments) and decided to just leave it at that.   This concludes my rant for now but no doubt i'll be back after delving longer into this abyss of boredom and bugginess..

If you ate to play every day for 14 hours (8 hours for him and 2 for other needs) and at the same time do not go to work / school, then to reach 1500 hours in Dota, you will have to play 107 days. Three and a half mets. Just play and nothing else. Are you still proud of Tim? besides your life, DotA also takes your money. Now your friend has a way of getting a legendary on his favorite hero, and now you also want to get a legendary! And you go and donate. You buy in-game textures that don't exist. You buy air. And I don’t need any comments about the fact that Dota develops reaction and tactics. You can only come up with a tactic for DotA heroes and on the DotA map, in reality it will not bring any benefit. and, as compared to k, the reaction of DotA Ovem does not develop.

However if you care about achievements, this should be an easy way to get another 100%. + Short + Fascinating premise + ‘Skip’ works flawlessly - Dumb protagonist -  Cliche, unoriginal twists  ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆★★★  3/10 - Bad This visual novel simply didn’t live up to the interesting premise it set up so I’m forced to give a bad rating to BAD END. While it wasn’t completely awful to sit through, there simply isn’t anything too engaging or memorable about the whole experience. The protagonist is so unrelatably idiotic in getting himself into the mess that it’s just hard to care about him surviving through all of it and it becomes more fun to see how many ways is there for him to die.   It needs to be mentioned that the player is presented with choices to make the protagonist less dumb but these bring the story to an end and thus are not correct choices. It is understandable that with a premise like this there needs to be something driving the protagonist to go through with it, but in this case it feels too feeble of a reason what is given to work here. The story offers no surprises and the supposed big twist is painfully obvious. The characters are uninteresting and it feels strange that some seem to have been inserted just to create an illusion of bigger cast. On a more positive side, the art is okay and BAD END plays well, it’s very easy to go through it multiple times since the ‘Skip’ function makes it effortless. There are several choices and they (for the most part) lead to different types of outcomes, but it seems like there should’ve been more “real endings rather than just a ton of dead ends.

4566,"I'm not even sure what to say about this game. I watched some videos on Youtube of some streamers playing it and it looked good. I thought it would be a great game worthy of a good investment. Oh boy what a mistake and how wrong I was. I gave my Uboat orders to dock at a port and my boat literally just kept slamming into a wall / dock. Wouldn't dock so I could restock supplies or anything. Just kept slamming into the wall like a mentally handicapped goose flying into a window over and over. Didn't want to do anything but slam into the dock without docking... -facepalm- No wonder Germany lost the war if that's how they operated. Then I would put people on the listening devices and radios to ""pick up contacts"". I would have them working on it and they would NEVER find contacts even if a boats were nearby. My captain or watcher on duty would see smoke plumes from the smoke stacks before they heard anything. Then when I get into range to try to ""assault / hunt"" the ships I would dive down and instantly everyone's mood starts plummeting. ""Oh it's the wrong colored lights, oh I can't listen to the radio, oh I can't...."" like seriously. We just started combat and my ""discipline"" went from 100 to 50 in no time flat. These are sailors / soldiers? More like preschool cry babies...sheesh. Then during the ""hunts"" I would try to line up my torpedo shots but most of the time I would run too low on oxygen from being underwater just part of a day while trying to plan out my attack and line up the shots. If you surface you get blown to bits. There is no proper balance. If you don't come up along their side and happen to get your listener to make a contact and know where they are then your spotter won't give you enough warning to get into position and dive before being spotted. I have no clue what this game is supposed to be but it's far from a proper Uboat simulator / WW2 sub simulator. I was thoroughly disappointed in this to say the least. I can't believe it has this many issues to be honest. Can zoom in as 1st person in the Uboat and the details are nice Good food management system for morale, but otherwise morale system is whack Decent old timey music playing on the radios Cool ocean water graphics and details of boats Balance of morale system and oxygen for getting close enough to fight without dying is a bit busted Whiney soldiers get annoying how low their morale gets so quickly No decent tutorial and they even say ""we're working on it"" but from my understanding it's been that way for quite some time and even Youtube seems to not have any up to date good tutorial videos. UI is not very intuitive. Trying to figure out what buttons to push for what / where is very difficult for beginners. I watched some older videos to try to learn things and half of the things still didn't make sense or work properly. That's a big mood killer within itself. Who wants to play a game where you spend hours figuring out some basic controls? Docking issues preventing you from resupplying and getting into the base Listeners not working properly / picking up contacts (even with extra soldiers helping them at their station) Had a few times where my torpedo ""fire screen"" would bug out and stay on the screen and not go away or work properly. Pull up the map to move and ''HEY KIDS YOU WANNA FIRE A TORPEDO!?"" No I want to move my boat...I had to save and reload to fix it.  Sometimes giving people orders they wouldn't do it and seemed to bug out (always when changing light colors) If the devs put the time, love, effort and energy into balance and fixing quality of life issues as they did the ocean graphics this game would be great. For right now I highly recommend that you WAIT to see if / when they fix these balancing issues and make docking work properly. Unless you want to play a WW2 whining simulator where if Adolf can't listen to his Swing music, eat food, play cards and have his favorite colored light bulb all the time without losing his temper then you'll enjoy this game. Otherwise this is not a decent submarine game. Other people mention silent hunter I think it was? That might be worth taking a look at. As for right now I'm thoroughly disappointed yet again by another let down of a game this year on Steam. Seems 2020 has brought out the worst everywhere even in Steam games. ",False,True
4567,"Rating: 5/10 Arcade racing players please note: This game is ours. Everyone pushed ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection"". To evaluate this game, you must first explain a professional racing term: Slipstream. Refers to when the car is driving in a straight line at high speed, following the car, using the slip and its own air resistance of the car when driving at high speed to achieve the purpose of overtaking at the moment of turning. This tour is a very special racing tour. It will lift the role of slippery to the point of exaggeration, even excitement. Using slip, the player has no chance to win the game. However, there are fewer NPC vehicles in the game, and there are more chances of slipping. In addition to sliding, the driving experience of other parties in this game can be satisfying, both refreshing and real. Most of the time, players are spent in the torment of lagging driving experience. Well, I am sex, I want to always stick the flowers of the car for some reason. So I choose to refund. In addition, the difficulty of the tour is too high, enough to retire all casual players and most racing birds. The highlight of the tour is only in the nostalgic style and simple works. To be honest, I can explain why this tour has such a high praise rate. In my opinion: The gameplay of this work can be compared to the super Renping's ""Top Gear 2"" and the arcade level ""OutRun"".

You play for about an hour and you've pretty much gotten the gameplay loop, so if you enjoy said loop you'll like this game... but if you are like me, you'll quickly grow tired. Despite there being a lot of individual variety the whole game kinda blends together into one monotonous mess. The controls are horrific no matter which type you use.  The UI: I'm surprised more people don't mention this. The menus are fine, but in game the UI is maybe some of the worst I've seen. It's hard to tell the the symbols apart, and the coloring doesn't help at all to tell them apart. Even the ammo bars are confusing as hell, as it seems to go out of its way to color them weirdly per mech and it can get hard to tell which gun you are firing in the heat of battle. I have no idea how they made the UI both minimalistic and cluttered at the same time. As I mentioned with the gameplay itself, the UI blends itself into the background as you play, which is a bad thing when you're forced to micromanage ammo consumption and attempt to navigate the map while aiming.   Mechs: The bread and butter of the game. I didn't play long enough to try a lot out, but the smaller the mech is the harder the game is. It's kinda like a self-determining difficulty setting, which i do like. The only problem is that the controls are so bad, plus the bad aiming.... its really really hard to do anything stealthy. You'll try to sneak around and get caught on houses or walls because the mech controls like a retarded duck. And the grav controls are literally the worst. Even the camera controls seek to upset the player lol. You can toggle locked camera and a camera that lets you zoom out... but with how the game works you're pretty much forced to use the zoom camera constantly to see incoming threats. Since the mouse controls both aiming and how the camera moves, even shooting your damn guns becomes an arduous task.  In summary: It has potential if you are willing to invest a lot of time to acclimate to the control scheme. The controls make the game, rather than the other way round. Adding an obtuse aiming system and confusing UI is just the icing on the cake for me to refund. On a bright note, I found the writing to be intruiging and was never a chore to read through. I hope they streamline the sequel a little; I don't mind the clunky movement, as that is what mechs are. I just hope they fix how the controls, camera, and aiming angles all interact together. If I could operate the systems, I'm sure I'd have a blast with the different playstyles available. ",False,False

About a half-dozen easy hidden-object scenes that can be completed in less than a minute each, maybe two. Very few self-contained puzzles including an early one with flowers so annoying I decided to skip it. Too many doors and containers to unlock. Good items that could be useful later were usually discarded after one use (but that's a common flaw of the genre). Artificial barriers to progression were present when something easier could have been done. For example, putting the toys on the floor instead of a toy box you have to fix first or using a similar item instead of the only once accepted. The map doesn't show you which rooms have something to do right now, but which ones that have something left to do at some point sometime, maybe much later, which means a lot of backtracking.

Basically a remote                     touchpad in the shape of a controller with some controls thrown on there so that it                    can be marketed as such.                7.   When I returned it, the people at the store COMPLETELY understood and we                      commiserated  (as much as someone that must sell the product really can) about our                     mutual dissatisfaction with it. That should say it all. This is a feature-driven product that allows for a ton of customizations/configurations for what might currently be a small niche of gamers.  It is not a performance or ease-of-use driven product, however, and for all the features it offers it makes little difference when simply holding the device is so awkward and counterintuitive. For someone with small hands, the buttons are hard to reach, for those with larger hands, your thumbs will likely be touching due to the the ridiculously small area designated to the stick and ABXY buttons.  I look to controllers more for performance and ease-of-use than I do for unlimited configurations and fun-but-unnecessary features.  A decent remote touchpad, if that's what you're looking for, but it's sold as a full-on game controller, and it's not a very good one of those. ",False,False

One of the many examples on how to ruin a great idea by lazyness. I should have known what was to come because F1 2014 was released roughly at the same time and it was a massive disappointment. You might ask how is this game ruined? Well lets start of with the career mode where you have to buy your own cars to get up in the rally ranks which for me is ridiculous. And because all the slower cars are from 1960's and 1970's why would anyone want to start their careers on such cars?  Career mode should have been done in a way that some games have done them before. You are a young talented driver who has to show their skills to earn a drive in a slower car and convince top team bosses to offer you a contract in a winning team. Something similar to Project Cars, but in a rally style. Then there is the lack of tracks on this game. Everybody is telling Codemasters exactly same thing, but what do they do? They keep quiet and do nothing. Reminds me of F1 2011 which had all kinds of crashing issues (Which were never patched surprise surprise its Code""masters"") I could rant on and on, but there are many positive things on this game aswell.

Then to see your character making these decisions that I personally thought were, at best, flighty. Its a shame the character didn't ruminate over her situation until the end.

Probably ranked in Champion 1 with little mechanical skill because the IQ of people in this game is awful overall, even in Champion rank.  Players don't rotate, constantly chase the ball, go after boost in the corners instead of defending, etc. Rocket League was much more fun in the early days when there was some map variety.  But instead of allowing people to actually enjoy the game, they dumbed down the maps to be all nearly the exact same.  Game gets worse and worse every year it seems.

4902,"Godus is a typical Peter Molyneux game. You can see that both positively and negatively. It makes a lot of promises, but doesn't keep a lot, but it's still fun and can even be addictive for a while. Godus has many problems in the current state. It starts with the fact that it is pure click-proof, although that has improved slightly with the last patches. The gameplay also offers far too little variation and challenge at the moment. It's hard to feel like God when you're so limited. But as I said, there are also things that the game does well. The graphic style is nice, the terrain editing concept is largely successful and it is fun to shape the world according to your ideas. And if you really get into it, you can lose track of time. Despite everything, I can't recommend the game at this point in time. But if the gameplay should be expanded, the click frequency reduced massively and more variety brought in, then lovers of this genre should definitely find pleasure in it.

But still, the game remains incredibly unstable post official release which is to some unnaceptable -myself partially included. Furthermore, the game graphics aren't that bad either to be fair to Bluewhole their graphics are not the worst, however the anticheat needs work; not a fault of their own necessarily more Battleye's but nevertheless it could still be improved as cheating is a prominent presence in this game. The actual gameplay wouldn't be too bad, if the prior poor optimization issues were fixed. A recent addition to the game which I believe appeals more to newer players, is the ability to vault through gaps, which seems insignificant however when being flanked compared to before, this is a game changer -now everyone can use this move whereas before only a particular type of player could.

He opens his crate like a lottery ticket, revealing his prize: Another crappy tank top. ""Curses,"" he thinks to himself. ""That vomit-yellow track suit I want is just out of my grasp!""

However, as I started to see more and more blatant examples of hacking (such as a half-naked female who absorbed an entire clip from my S12K and then teleported up the road), I decided to log into the test servers instead. The test servers do not allow anyone to keep their rewards, so there's absolutely no monetary incentive for hackers to be there. Lo and behold, I found myself on a server with people who acted like human beings instead of ruthless, efficient killing machines. In my second game I got four kills and earned my first chicken dinner. Guess I'm not so bad at the game after all! This is a sad state of affairs. PUBG is an enjoyable game that is being summarily ruined. Brendan ""Playerunknown"" Greene has acknowledged that hacking is a big problem; he has also released ban numbers that have broken previous Steam records. In   he even said that they were banning six thousand cheaters a day, the majority of which are from China. And while six thousand might seem like a lot, PUBG now has  , which means that six thousand is a tiny drop in the bucket. He has also stated that he takes a hard stance on hacking - Firm bans with no appeals. That's good, but it doesn't address the reason that hackers show up in the first place, which is to sell their crates. If he's really serious about the situation, he needs to shut down the crate market, period. To hell with the whales who bought $100 items to outfit their characters. If he wants to save the game's reputation, that's the only way. If you're a potential buyer and want some advice as to whether to play this game, I will tell you right now to  , because there is no indication that the hacking will ever be properly addressed. The test servers can provide you with a hacker-free experience if you're okay with forfeiting your rewards, but those servers are extremely buggy and likely won't be around forever (they will probably disappear after the game is out of early access). Thus, if you play on the regular servers, you are guaranteed to encounter at least one hacker every time you play. Trust me, it's not your imagination. The hackers are out there, and they are lining their pockets with your failures. ",False,False

First of all you have to say that this game was a lot of fun and I invested many hours, but afterwards I am very sad to have played so many hours. Valve doesn't care about the community at all and there is little or no new content. They just try to make money and don't pay attention to the community and the longtime players. . . There are many hackers and the ranking system should be completely reworked, because at the moment you can't play properly anymore, because every 2 players hacks or smurfs. Furthermore, there are hardly any capable or communicative players. If these speeches they are in 90% of the cases on Flemings or speeches something Russian, which absolutely does not contribute to the match. What you could really use are new maps. They also removed maps from the comp. and in normal game mode that many people would play, including me. If there are any questions after this review or if you still want to buy the game I can only wish that you find out for yourself and also write such a review. Since Valve won't read this and doesn't take it seriously, it's more directed at the community. Furthermore, you should not buy keys. I'm afraid I fell for that and lost a lot of money. The game is just not fun!  And now the Game is for free and there are just more hackers!

4988,"This game is truly a masterpiece, I was unable to speak for 10 days after downloading this piece of art, at first I thought it was a curse given by the cave dweller that created this game, but then shortly after, I was enlightened. I dream't of a beautiful meadow, I was grazing on pure gold wheat that glistened in the sunlight, a buddha like figure slowly approached me and said, ""life is feudal"" when I awoke from this I then knew it was time, I ran to my computer and opened Life is Feudal and my previously curved monitor grew 10 inches in size and turned into a flatscreen tv mounted on my wall, my door was kicked open, and there he was, the buddha from my dream, he licked my monitor screen and told me ""Life is Feudal"" he leapt out my window and vanished. I am leaving this review 6 days after this event. Please download this game, please I beg of you, you shall be enlightened, you shall overcome, you shall install Life is Feudal. ",False,True

4991,"Encountered many issues with this game Started off, it wouldn't let me download. My internet was fine and it just wouldn't do it. Somehow I managed to download it. Bootup the game, my controller is detected as 2 different ones, and made me play as both RedCup and BlueCup. This made me spend 20 minutes finding a fix for this. At this point I had spent 12 hours trying to actually get into the game, and I have done this finally, only to have a very small payoff. The soundtrack was decent but not good enough to warrant me spending an extra $10 on it, and the levels got stale very quickly. I only got to spend about half an hour on it before I just got bored of it.  The difficulty I found was rather pleasing, having played Hotline Miami 1 and 2 and Dark Souls, this game was one of the somewhat easier ones, but alas it got too boring before I could really do much.

4993,"Both the game and the DLC are sensational, but the negative is due to the nut performance Capcom implemented in the DLC, you see, they postponed the PC version with the excuse of bringing the best possible experience, in the case it was the opposite, before I did ran smoothly with graphic pack installed without crashing (only dropped frame (55fps) in area 1 of the Ancestral Forest), now it's horrible, with everything at the top it drops to 50 fps and worse, if I download the settings the FPS dropped to 45 (with that feeling of playing at 20 fps for frametime). If you haven't bought it yet, I advise you to wait a little longer, especially if you have an AMD FX processor or a previous generation I5 (it is consuming 100% of the CPU). Even the Ryzens 5 (my case) are on the verge of 96% usage. Perhaps a clean installation or an att. drive resolution, but apparently they’re not going to do that anytime soon. Flock of mercenary pdf.

4995,"What can I say...this game is horrible. Luckily I got it in a bundle but thought well I liked the movie maybe I will like the game but boy was I wrong. -No tutorial -Doesn't even have an image on my profile -The controls and aiming are horrible and clunky at best.  -Headshot - Nope didn't kill, Legshot - oh that killed it in one hit, makes complete sense. -Aim right at them and the bullets seem to take their own path at times to a completely unrelated area. -You are able to play single player by settng up a custum match but that wasn't even enjoyable and seemed almost impossible to win that way. -Multiplayer seems dead. -Graphics - Meh they are okay. -Basically just a wave based killing spree and nothing else, no real campaign, no real story so doesn't even really cover the movie much in any form. Now only letting it run to get the remainder of the trading cards and will be uninstalling it right after.  1/10 do not recommend. Glad it only got it in a bundle and did not buy it on its own at full price. ",False,False
4996,"Let me just say that I’m a huge Silent Hill fan. Silent Hill 2 was the game that first got me into the horror genre, and I have never been the same since. But I’m not here to discuss what makes one a “true fan, I’m here to discuss why Silent Hill: Homecoming isn’t a good Silent Hill game. Perhaps it might be considered good horror by some, but for anyone who has played and loved the first 3-4 titles in the series, and perhaps found themselves obsessing over the depths and intricacies of the stories at one time or another, they’ll get none of that here. Homecoming is a shallow interpretation of what Japanese horror is, and it fails horribly at almost every single thing it attempts to accomplish. The story itself starts off promising enough with our protagonist, Alex Shepherd, waking up to find himself in a hospital where patients are horribly tortured and mutilated, their remains tossed about like so much meaningless flesh. Upon waking from what is clearly a nightmare, we find Alex in the cabin of a trucker (Travis from Origins), who is giving him a lift back home to Shepherd’s Glen after having just been discharged from military service. There he discovers the town isn’t exactly how he left it, nor is his family.  One would think uncovering the mystery behind what happened to Alex's little brother would be terrifying, but it’s not. Almost every horror trope in the book is summoned forth here, at least when the lore from the previous games isn't being bastardized.  Homecoming is what Japanese horror looks like if you shove it through the lens of a Western game developer; the symbolism is blatant, everything is over-explained, and there is a reliance on action over atmosphere, which is the biggest mistake a game in this series could possibly make. Silent Hill is not about combat. It never has been. It’s about the dread of what you’ll be witnessing next. It’s about the unknown and what horrors it holds. It’s about seeing  up  and trying to understand how, or why, that  up  even exists. It’s not getting bombarded by monsters. It’s not fighting through gauntlets of fiends. It’s not fighting bosses over and over and over again because the combat system doesn’t allow you to attack something unless you’re locked onto it. It’s not having to dodge attacks with absolute precision in order to avoid them. It’s not having an artificial limit on how many bullets you can carry even though your melee weapons are 9 times out of 10 the better option. Even the soundtrack feels bland and phoned in. Sure, the vocal themes are great, mostly because they’re held up by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn's fantastic performance, but there are few memorable tracks outside of the ending and opening themes and a couple of melodies we hear repeated throughout the game. The rest of it is all just…forgettable noise. I could honestly continue on for several more paragraphs going into how much I hate that they ripped several things straight out of the first movie, how embarrassingly “wink wink, nudge nudge all of the game’s Easter Eggs are, how much I abhor that Alex is basically another James Sunderland, but I just want to be done with this garbage and move on. No, I would NOT recommend Silent Hill: Homecoming to anyone who loved the earlier games in the series. But if you were to find yourself compelled to play this train wreck, even out of morbid curiosity, make sure you install that patch, adjust your sound settings, and go in with your expectations duly deflated. Maybe then, if you’re lucky, you’ll get some fleeting enjoyment out of it. ",False,False
